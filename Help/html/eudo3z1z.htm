<H2><A NAME="file_browser_window"></A>File Browser Window</H2>

<P>Use this window to browse the Windows desktop. You can use this window to find files to attach to new outgoing messages, for example.</P>

<P>To open the File Browser window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>File Browser</B>. Or, if the File Browser window is in a visible tabbed window, click its tab.</P>

<P>The File Browser window performs some, but not all, of the functions of the standard Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0 Explorer programs.</P>

<P>The File Browser window contains three controls:</P>

<P>•<B>Drive Selector</B> (top box) — A drop-down menu in this field contains a fixed set of high-level folders on your system, just like the corresponding control in Windows Explorer. The Drive Selector field determines what gets displayed in the Folder Browser (middle section). When you first launch Eudora, the Drive Selector automatically sets itself to the drive containing your Windows folder. Note that the first entry in the drop-down menu is a shortcut called "My Attachments" that points to your Eudora attachments folder.</P>

<P>•<B>Folder Browser</B> (middle section) — This is a tree control that displays the folder hierarchy whose root is the selection entered in the Drive Selector field. For example, if in the Drive Selector box you choose the C: drive, then the Folder Browser displays the folder tree-hierarchy branching down from the C: drive folder. Right-click a folder item in the Folder Browser to display the standard Windows context menu (right-click) for that folder.</P>

<P>•<B>File List</B> (bottom section) — This is a list control that displays the files contained in the folder selected in the Folder Browser. You can select one or more file items in the list, then right-click the selection to display the standard Windows context menu (right-click) for those files. (Note: Eudora does not fill in the Send To submenu on the context menu (right-click).) When selecting multiple items, use the <B>Shift</B> key to select a range of items, and use the <B>Ctrl</B> key for nonconsecutive selections.</P>

<P>The File List control shows these four columns:</P>

<P>•<B>Name</B> — Displays the name of the file and the icon associated with the file.</P>

<P>•<B>Type</B> — Based on the file name extension, displays the file type as set in the Options dialog box of Windows Explorer.</P>

<P>•<B>Size</B> — Displays the size of the file in kilobytes (K), where 1K = 1,024 bytes.</P>

<P>•<B>Modified</B> — Displays the date and time that the file was last modified.</P>

<P>As in Windows Explorer, you can click any of the four column headings to sort the listing by the data in that column.</P>

<P>You can also resize the widths of the columns by dragging the separator line between the column heading labels. Position the pointer over the separator until you see a splitter cursor, then drag the line to left or right.</P>

<P>In the File List control, double-click an item in the Name column, or select one or more items in the column and press <B>Enter</B>, to open the selected items. For program files, this action launches the program. For document files, this action generally launches the registered viewing or editing application for that document. Eudora displays an error dialog box if it is unable to open a file in this way.</P>

<P>To adjust the relative heights of the Folder Browser and File List controls, position the pointer over the separator bar between the Folder Browser and File List controls until the splitter cursor appears, then click and drag the separator up or down. Note that the File Browser window maintains a minimum height for the Folder Browser and File List controls, so you cannot close them all the way.</P>

<P>To manually refresh the File Browser window display, right-click anywhere in the File Browser window but <I>not</I> on a Folder Browser item or File List item, then choose <B>Refresh</B> from the context menu (right-click). (Tip: A good place to right-click is in the Drive Selector box.) Alternately, press the <B>F5</B> key while keyboard focus is in the File Browser window.</P>

<P>You can select one or more files in the File List control and drag them to a message composition window to attach those files to that outgoing message. This is especially handy if you keep the File Browser window docked and open. (For multiple file selections, use the <B>Shift</B> key to select a range, and use the <B>Ctrl</B> key to make nonconsecutive selections.)</P>

<P>You can also select one or more items in the File List control and drag them to another application that can receive such files.</P>

<P>In general, the File Browser window lets you drag items out of the window (copying them rather than moving them), but the window is not a proper drop target; you cannot drop items into the window that you’ve dragged from elsewhere on your desktop. In particular, you cannot move files by dragging them to a target folder in the Folder Browser control. You also cannot drag and drop items within the File Browser window (from one control to another, for example). You can, however, manage the files and folders in the window using the commands on the window’s context menu (right-click), such as Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete. </P>

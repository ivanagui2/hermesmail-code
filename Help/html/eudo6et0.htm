<P>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)</P>

<P>You can set up "multiple personalities" in Eudora for each email account you have. For example, if you have Work, Home, and School email accounts, you can set up Eudora to send and receive email from each of these accounts, all without having to quit and restart Eudora. That is, you can check mail either for all of your accounts, or for selected accounts at once, and you can do the same for sending mail.</P>

<P>You use the Personalities window and the Account Settings dialog to set up your personalities. Your "dominant" personality, or principal email account, is set up via the New Account Wizard when you install Eudora and can also be modified via the Account Settings dialog.</P>

<P>For detailed information on the Personalities window, its columns, the commands on its context menu (right-click), and the options in the Account Settings dialog, see <A HREF="eudo6lrr.htm">Personalities Window</A>. Below is the basic procedure for setting up alternate accounts, followed by additional information on using personalities to send and receive mail.</P>

<P>To create a new personality, or alternate email account, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Personalities </B>or click the Personalities window’s tab if it is the inactive window in a tabbed group. The Personalities window appears.</P>

<P>2.Right-click anywhere inside the Personalities window and choose <B>New</B> from the context menu (right-click). The first window of the New Account Wizard appears.</P>

<P>3.Follow the setup instructions in each window of the New Account Wizard to create the new personality. See <A HREF="eudo6lrr.htm">Personalities Window</A> for more information.</P>

<P>4.When you have completed the new account setup, click <B>Finish</B> and the new personality is created.</P>

<P>During new account setup you specify the personality name and the following items associated with the account: the real name, the return email address, the user name, and the incoming email server (POP or IMAP).</P>

<P>To modify an existing personality, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Open the Personalities window.</P>

<P>2.Right-click the desired personality to display the context menu (right-click).</P>

<P>3.Choose <B>Properties</B> and make your changes in the Account Settings dialog. For more information, see <A HREF="eudo19gn.htm">Account Settings Dialog</A>.</P>

<P>No options can be changed for alternate personalities except those specified in the New Account wizard or the Account Settings dialog; they are effective for all. If you want to change other options for an alternate personality or use a separate set of mailboxes for an account, see the section "Putting Multiple Users on One PC" in the online <I>Eudora User Manual</I> for additional information.</P>

<P>To create an outgoing message from an alternate account, that is, as an alternate personality, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Open a new message. </P>

<P>2.In the <B>From</B> field, click the arrow to display your personalities. Choose the desired personality.</P>

<P>Or, in the personality window, select the desired personality and press <B>Enter</B>. </P>

<P>Or, simply double-click the desired personality. A new message opens from that personality.</P>

<P>When the composition window opens in response to any of the three message-creation methods above, the default signature for the selected personality is used. But if a stationery file was selected or a default stationery file specified in the account’s options, then the signature stored with the stationery file is used. However, you can always change the signature drop-down in the composition window (for details, see <A HREF="eudo5ahx.htm">Using a Signature</A> ).</P>

<P>After you open a new composition message from a particular personality, you can also change the message’s personality, that is, the sender, by selecting the new personality from the <B>Change Personality</B> submenu under the Message menu. The <B>From</B> field of the message header changes to the information associated with the new personality.</P>

<P>When you respond to a message, Eudora assigns your response the same personality under which it received the message. For example, if you receive a message sent to your Home account, your replies to that message are sent from your Home account.</P>

<P><I>Note:You can also set up a filter to automatically assign a desired personality to incoming or outgoing messages that satisfy the filter criteria. See the <B>Make Personality</B> action in <A HREF="eudo6dir.htm">Filter Actions</A>.</I></P>

<P>•<B>Tab Contents</B> — A window tab contains both the icon and the text label associated with that window. If there is room enough in the tabbed window, both the icon and the label are displayed on each tab. If there is not enough room, only the icon appears for each tab. If only the icon is visible, pause the mouse pointer over the tab icon, and Eudora will display the tab text in a tool tip.</P>

<P>•<B>Tab Location</B> — By default, Eudora arranges window tabs along the bottom edge of a tabbed window. Sometimes it is more convenient to have the tabs displayed along a different edge. For example, in a short-and-wide tabbed window (one that is docked horizontally), you can improve the visibility of the window’s contents by moving the tabs to the right edge. To change the location of the tabs in a tabbed window, right-click the tabs or on the window border, and select a new location from the <B>Tab Location</B> submenu of the context menu (right-click).</P>

<P>•<B>Tab Auto-Activation</B> — During a drag and drop operation, if you pause the mouse pointer over the tab of an inactive window in a tabbed window, that window becomes active (is brought to the front), and you can complete the drop. For example, if you drag received messages to the Mailboxes window when it is inactive in a tabbed window, pause the pointer over the Mailboxes window’s tab; the window is made active and you can drop the messages in a mailbox. Note that tab auto-activation is disabled when you are dragging a tool window tab. </P>

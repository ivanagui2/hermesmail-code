<h2><a name="incoming_mail_options_window"></a>Incoming Mail Options Window</h2>

<p>The Incoming Mail options determine how HERMES receives incoming messages addressed to your primary email account. The options configure the incoming mail server, whose name is entered in the Mail Server (Incoming) field in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000199">Getting Started Options Window</a>.</p>

<p>To display the Incoming Mail options window, do the following:</p>

<p>1. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, select <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2. Click <b>Incoming Mail</b>. The Incoming Mail options window appears.</p>

<p>Listed below are field descriptions for Incoming Mail:</p>

<p><b>Server configuration —</b>— Specify which email protocol the incoming mail server uses: POP (Post Office Protocol) or IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). Ask your email administrator which one to use, if you are not sure.</p>

<p>The options in the rest of this window depend on whether you’ve chosen POP or IMAP in this field. Options for both configurations are described below:</p>

<p><b>When Server configuration = POP:</b></p>

<p><b>Leave mail on server —</b>— If this is on, HERMES copies incoming messages to your computer and leaves the message on the POP server. If this is off, HERMES transfers incoming messages to your computer and deletes the message from the POP server. For details, see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-00013B">Leaving Mail on the Server</a> and <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-00018B">Managing your Mail on a POP Server</a>.</p>

<p><b>Delete from server after _ day(s) —</b>— This option has a check box for turning it on and off and an edit box for specifying the number of days mail that was left on the POP server should be saved before being deleted. It is a good idea not to leave copies of your messages on the POP server indefinitely, as this will create mail storage problems on the server.</p>

<p><b>Delete from server when emptied from Trash —</b>— If this is on, any messages that are deleted from your Trash mailbox are also deleted from the POP server. For details, see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-00018B">Managing your Mail on a POP Server.</a> </p>

<p><b>Skip messages over _ K in size —</b>— If this is on, messages over the specified size are downloaded only in part. These messages include the first few lines, and a statement that says the message is not complete. This can be useful on slow connections. If you enter zero, all messages are downloaded.</p>

<p><b>Offline</b> —— If this is on, HERMES won’t attempt to make any connections. This is good to have on if you’re using HERMES on a laptop computer that is not continuously connected.</p>

<p><b>Authentication style —</b>— This specifies which POP account authentication technology to use for this account: Passwords, Kerberos, APOP, or RPA. Ask your email administrator which one to use, if you are not sure. Use RPA for CompuServe.</p>

<p><b>When Server configuration = IMAP:</b></p>

<p><b>IMAP Mailbox Location Prefix —</b>— This specifies the mailbox location prefix that IMAP will use when locating your mailboxes on the incoming mail server. An example prefix is /usr/mail. Ask your email administrator what to enter here, if you are not sure.</p>

<p><b>For new mail, download —</b>— These options (you must choose one) let you control the way incoming mail is downloaded from the IMAP server.</p>

<p><b>Minimal headers only —</b>— If this option is on, only a limited set of message headers, and nothing else, is downloaded for each incoming message. (That means the remaining message headers, the message body, and any attachments are not downloaded for the message.)</p>

<p><b>Full message except attachments over _ K —</b>— If this option is on, the full message (full set of message headers and the message body) and any attachments smaller than the specified size are downloaded for each incoming message. Also, any attachments larger than the specified size are not downloaded with the message. To download all of your IMAP attachments, enter a large number in this field.</p>

<p><b>When I delete a message</b>—These options (you must choose one) let you control the way you want your deleted messages handled.</p>

<p><b>Mark it as deleted</b>—Select this option to mark your messages on the IMAP for deletion. These messages are not removed from the server until you choose to remove them. See <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-0001A3">Deleting a Message from the IMAP Server</a>.</p>

<p><b>Move it to (mailbox</b>)—Select this option to move your deleted messages to a specific mailbox. The default is your Trash mailbox.<b>  </b></p>

<p><b>When I delete a message</b>—These options (you must choose one) let you control the way you want your deleted messages handled.</p>

<p><b>Authentication style</b>—This specifies which IMAP account authentication technology to use for this account: Passwords, Kerberos, or CRAM-MD5. Ask your email administrator which one to use if you are not sure.</p>

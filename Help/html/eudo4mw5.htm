<P>1. From the <B>Message</B> menu, choose <B>Reply With</B>.</P>

<P>2. From the <B>Reply With</B> submenu, select a stationery file. The stationery file is opened as a message and is addressed as appropriate (your Replying options are used). For information on stationery files, see <A HREF="eudo2ph5.htm">Using Stationery</A>.</P>

<P>Other ways to reply with stationery:</P>

<P>•With the desired message open or selected in a mailbox window, open the Stationery window, right-click a stationery item, and choose <B>Reply With</B> from the drop-down menu.</P>

<P>•With the desired message open or selected in a mailbox window, open the Personalities window, right-click a personality, and choose <B>Reply As</B> from the <B>Message</B> submenu of the drop-down menu. The default stationery assigned to that personality is used in the reply.</P>

<P>•With the Personalities window open, drag an open message by its Mailbox (with arrow), or drag selected message summaries in a mailbox window onto a personality in the Personalities window: a reply is initiated from that personality, and the stationery stored with that personality is used in the reply.</P>

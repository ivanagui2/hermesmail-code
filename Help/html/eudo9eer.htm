<P>(Paid mode only)</P>

<P>When you check for mail, Eudora recognizes which incoming messages are junk, and those messages are filtered into the Junk mailbox. Your incoming mail goes through the Junk filter before any other filter you may have set up. After a certain number of days (30 days is the default), Eudora automatically deletes these messages. </P>

<P>Occasionally, messages Eudora filters into the Junk mailbox may, in fact, not be junk mail. There is a new option on the Message menu that allows you to transfer wanted mail to the appropriate mailboxes.</P>

<P>To manage messages that are not junk in the Junk mailbox:</P>

<P>1.Scan the messages in the Junk mailbox and select those that you consider not junk mail. </P>

<P>2.From the Message menu, choose <B>Not Junk</B>. Or right-click on the message and choose <B>Not Junk</B> from the context menu.</P>

<P>3.By choosing the Not Junk command, the messages you selected are automatically filtered to go to the designated mailboxes you have previously set up. </P>

<P>With time, Eudora learns which messages are not junk and filters them to your designated mailboxes automatically. </P>

<P>Conversely, if you find Junk mail in your other mailboxes, just choose Junk from the Message menu, and these messages are transferred to the Junk mailbox. With time, Eudora eventually learns to recognize these messages as junk and filters them into the Junk mailbox.</P>

<P>To manually set up a Junk filter, see <A HREF="eudo3nc9.htm">Filter Criteria (The Match Area).</A> </P>

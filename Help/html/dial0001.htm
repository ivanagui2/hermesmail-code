<P>The return email address used in outgoing messages and your recipients' replies for this account, if the address is different from this personality's incoming email account. The address you enter is included in the From field of all your outgoing messages from this account, and when a recipient replies to a message from this personality, the reply is sent to this address. If you do not enter an address in this field, Eudora uses the personality's incoming email account as the return address. Note: If you do enter an address in this field, first test the address to be sure that mail sent to it is indeed delivered to you. If you use an invalid return address, no one will be able to reply to your mail sent from this personality.</P>

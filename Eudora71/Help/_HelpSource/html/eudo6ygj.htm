<p>The behavior of some Eudora features internal and external to the Directory Services window depends on the state of the window. For definitions of window states, see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-0000E0">Window States and Tabbed Windows</a>.</p>

<p>When the Directory Services window is in the docked or floating state (either alone or as part of a tabbed window group), the following applies:</p>

<p>•The <b>Keep on top</b> setting in the window is ignored.</p>

<p>•The <b>To</b>, <b>Cc</b>, and <b>Bcc</b> buttons in the window apply to the topmost composition window, if any.</p>

<p>•The Special menu <b>Make Address Book Entry</b> command, and the File menu <b>Print Preview</b> and <b>Print</b> commands, apply to the Directory Services window only if the keyboard focus is in that window.</p>

<p>When the Directory Services window is in the normal state (either alone or as part of a tabbed window group), the following applies:</p>

<p>•The <b>Keep on top</b> setting in the window is obeyed.</p>

<p>•The <b>To</b>, <b>Cc</b>, and <b>Bcc</b> buttons in the window apply to the composition window, if any, immediately under the Directory Services window or the tabbed window containing it.</p>

<p>•The Special menu <b>Make Address Book Entry</b> command, and the File menu <b>Print Preview</b> and <b>Print</b> commands, apply to the Directory Services window only if it is the topmost normal window and is active, or if the tabbed window containing it is the topmost normal window and the Directory Services tab is active.</p>

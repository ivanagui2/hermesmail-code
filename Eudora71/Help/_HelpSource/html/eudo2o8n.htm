<h2><a name="mapi_options_window"></a>MAPI Options Window</h2>

<p>The MAPI Options control the Eudora MAPI Server. Eudora’s MAPI support allows you to quickly attach documents to email messages directly from the application that created the document. Without MAPI, users must first save the document, remember what folder the document is in, switch to Eudora, and then remember to manually attach the document to the outgoing message.</p>

<p>MAPI streamlines this process dramatically. To email the current, open document from your word processor, select the Send command from your word processor’s File menu. This automatically activates Eudora and attaches a snapshot of the open document to a new composition message.</p>

<p>The MAPI system standardizes how messages are handled by client applications so that each client application does not have to have custom code for each target messaging application. MAPI accomplishes this by providing a standard application program interface used by all MAPI-enabled client applications.</p>

<p>An additional MAPI feature supported by Microsoft Office applications is the ability to add a "routing slip" to a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint document. This routing slip contains a list of email recipients obtained from the MAPI subsystem. Once a document has an embedded routing slip, then it can be semi-automatically routed as an attachment via email to all recipients listed in the routing slip. Once the routing is complete, the annotated document is returned back to the original sender.</p>

<p>See <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-0000E4">Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI)</a>.</p>

<p>To display the MAPI options window, do the following:</p>

<p>1. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, select <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2. Scroll and click <b>MAPI</b>. The MAPI options window appears.</p>

<p>Listed below are field descriptions for MAPI:</p>

<p><b>Use Eudora MAPI server</b> —— If Never is selected, the Eudora MAPI server is off and is never automatically loaded. If When Eudora is running is selected, the Eudora MAPI server is on when Eudora is running. If Always is selected, the Eudora MAPI server is on and is always loaded on startup.</p>

<p><b>Delete MAPI attachments —</b>— If Never is selected, MAPI attachments are never deleted from the attachment directory. If After sending message is selected, MAPI attachments are deleted from the attachment directory when their corresponding messages are sent. If  When message emptied from Trash is selected, MAPI attachments are deleted from the attachment directory when their corresponding messages are emptied from the Trash.</p>

<p><b>Send single MAPI file attachment as inline attachment (TXT and HTML files only)</b> —— Turn this on when you need to have the MAPI client send a single TXT or HTML file as an attachment with no body text. Eudora turns off the Text As Attachment button in the outgoing message toolbar (if it is on), so that the document is sent to the recipient as inline text in the message body. This allows MAPI clients, such as Internet Explorer, to pass Web pages and other HTML and TXT documents right into the body of the Eudora message. (The Text As Attachment button, if turned on in the outgoing message toolbar, instructs Eudora to attach text files, such as TXT and HTML, to the message rather than incorporating the text into the message as part of the message body. The default state of this button is controlled by the Put text attachments in body of message option in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-0000C7">Attachments options</a> . See the section <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-0001A4">Using the Composition Window</a>.</p>

<p><b>Warn on MAPI auto-send of message—</b>—Turn this on to get a security warning when you receive messages that are automatically sent from other applications through MAPI.<b> </b></p>

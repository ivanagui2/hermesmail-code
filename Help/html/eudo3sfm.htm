<P>This feature allows you to concentrate text inside a single message by trimming redundant headers and text in the message window. You can also group threaded messages and view them with trimmed headers and text all at once in the preview pane of a mailbox. Threaded messages are messages you receive that were either sent, forwarded, or redirected to you about the same subject or from the same sender. </P>

<P>To concentrate text inside a single message:</P>

<P>1.From the Tools menu, choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2.Scroll and choose <B>Content Concentrator</B>.</P>

<P>The Content Concentrator options window opens.</P>

<P>In the Single Message Profiles, choose <B>Compact</B> or <B>Terse</B> for each field (preview pane and/or message window) from the drop-down menu.  For more information, see <A HREF="eudo3upj.htm">Content Concentrator Options Window</A>.</P>

<P>To group threaded messages and view them in the preview pane: </P>

<P>1.In the selected mailbox, select and highlight the message you want to group. </P>

<P>2.Press the Alt key and click on the message. </P>

<P><I>Note:   You can group messages in two ways, by sender or by subject. Click the sender's name or subject when pressing the Alt key. The messages are grouped by sender or by subject. </I></P>

<P>All messages that are threaded to the selected message appear together.</P>

<P>All the highlighted messages in the thread appear with abbreviated headers in the preview pane. </P>

<P>The messages appear concentrated as a single message in the preview pane.</P>

<P><B>Changing the level of concentration from the preview pane</B></P>

<P>Content Concentrator allows you to change the level of concentration right from the preview pane.  Instead of setting the level of concentration in your Eudora Options, you can now change the level for each mailbox.</P>

<P>To change the level for each mailbox:</P>

<P>1.Click the Content Concentrator button directly above the Preview Pane in the middle of the mailbox, between the "Mailbox Size Display" and the horizontal scrollbar. A contextual menu appears.</P>

<P>2.Choose one of the options from the contextual menu. If a single message is highlighted, the default is Compact. If multiple messages are highlighted, the default is Terse. </P>

<P>3.Choose one of the following options:</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>None - This turns off Content Concentrator. There is no change in the message format.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Compact - Message is truncated; that is, excess headers and text are removed and replaced with ellipses and a snip indicator. Only the To:, From:, Subject:,  and CC: headers appear in the message.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Terse - Message is truncated further; only the From: field of the header appears in the message and the concentrated body of the message.</P>

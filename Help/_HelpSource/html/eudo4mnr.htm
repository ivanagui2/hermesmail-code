<h2><a name="composing_mail_options_window"></a>Composing Mail Options Window</h2>

<p>The Composing Mail options determine what Eudora features are available to you when composing messages.</p>

<p>To display the Composing Mail options window, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools </b>menu, choose <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2.Scroll and click the <b>Composing Mail</b> icon. The Composing Mail options window appears. </p>

<p>Listed below are field descriptions for Composing Mail:</p>

<p><b>Default Stationery </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—This is the default stationery to be used in all outgoing messages from your dominant account. Select a stationery file from the drop-down list, or select &lt;No Default&gt; for no default stationery. If a stationery file is selected, that file is used when you open new messages from this account (except with the Redirect or Send Again commands). The message toolbar in the composition window is set according to how the stationery message was saved, regardless of how the options below are set. But, you can always change them after you open the message. </p>

<p><b>When not using Stationery </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—The values you choose for the following options apply only when you are not using a default stationery file, that is, when the "Select a default Stationery for new messages" option, above, is set to &lt;No Default&gt;, if you have selected a default stationery file from the drop-down list, then the values below are ignored. Instead, Eudora uses their corresponding values that were set when the stationery file was saved. So, for example, if you choose default stationery that uses a custom signature and you set the default signature drop-down list below to your Standard signature, your Standard signature will be ignored and the custom signature will be used.</p>

<p><b>Show signature while composing—</b> If this is selected, you will see the signature you have previously set up in the message composition window. If off, you will not see the signature. To set up a signature, see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-00013C">Using a Signature</a>. </p>

<p><b>Word wrap—</b> If this is selected, Eudora automatically inserts carriage returns in long lines when a message is sent, creating roughly 76 characters per line. This makes the message legible on the recipient’s computer. It is a good idea not to include your own carriage returns within paragraphs if you have this option on. Use carriage returns only to create new paragraphs. We strongly recommend that you leave this option selected. The default stationery overrides this option (see above).</p>

<p><b>Keep copies—</b>If this is selected, a copy of each message you send is kept in the Out mailbox. If this option is turned off, outgoing messages are put in the Trash mailbox after they are sent. Default stationery overrides this option (see above).</p>

<p><b>May use quoted-printable—</b>If this is selected, Eudora uses quoted-printable encoding when necessary, such as when sending messages that contain special characters or long lines of text. If this option is turned off, quoted-printable encoding is never used. We recommend that you leave this option selected. Default stationery overrides this option.</p>

<p><b>Tabs in body of message—</b>If this is selected, pressing the Tab key within the message body inserts a tab. If it is turned off, pressing the Tab key within the message body moves the cursor to the To: field. Default stationery overrides this option (see above).</p>

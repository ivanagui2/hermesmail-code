<P>If your incoming mail server uses the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), you manage your mail, mailboxes, and folders on the server, not on your computer. You actually create mailboxes and on the server, but  you can see them in the Mailboxes window in Eudora. When you launch Eudora, you retrieve your mailboxes and folders from the server. When you check mail, the mail you retrieve is filtered on the server although your filters are created in Eudora. This is beneficial if you have to retrieve mail from different computers because your mail remains on the server for you to retrieve at anytime on any computer.</P>

<P>During mail checks, partial messages or full messages are transferred to your computer, with or without attachments, depending on the options you specify in the Incoming Mail options window for your main account (see <A HREF="eudo8rp3.htm">Incoming Mail Options Window</A>). This is beneficial if you use a computer with limited disk space or a slow network connection. To specify options for your personalities, access the Account Settings dialog box from the Personalities window (see <A HREF="eudo19gn.htm">Account Settings Dialog</A>). </P>

<P>When a message is transferred either in part or in full from the IMAP server to your computer during a mail check, a copy of the message remains on the server until you actively delete it. </P>

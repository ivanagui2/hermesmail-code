These files are used by a program called aclocal (part of the GNU automake
package).  aclocal uses these files to create aclocal.m4 which is in turn
used by autoconf to create the configure script at the the top level in
this distribution.

For the building the executable hunspell the following m4 files are needed:

* iconv.m4
* lib-link.m4
* lib-ld.m4
* lib-prefix.m4

These originate from the package `gettext` from the path `/usr/share/aclocal/`.
These files used to be found automatically, but with the removal of gettext they
need to be added manually. Once the executable nuspell completely replaces the
executable hunspell, these three files will not be needed anymore and need to
get removed here.

For nuspell the following is needed:

* boost.m4
* ax_code_coverage.m4

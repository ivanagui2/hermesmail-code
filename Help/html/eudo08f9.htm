<P>Incoming messages can be sent to a new recipient "by way of" you, maintaining the original sender’s address in the <B>From</B> field. This is called redirecting.</P>

<P>To redirect the current message, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Message</B> menu, choose <B>Redirect</B>. </P>

<P>A new message window appears with the original sender’s address in the <B>From</B> field and the statement "by way of" followed by your real name and/or return address, the original sender’s text in the message body, and the original attachments in the <B>Attached</B> field. Make any changes you want, and enter the recipient’s address in the <B>To</B> field. The message can then be sent or saved for further changes.</P>

<P><I>Note:You may want to enclose any changes in brackets ([]) so that you don’t confuse the recipient about who wrote what.</I></P>

<P>Messages that have been redirected are identified with a <B>diagonal arrow </B>pointing up and right in the Status column of their message summary.</P>

<P>Other ways to redirect a message:</P>

<P>•With the desired message open or selected in a mailbox window, open the Personalities window, right-click a personality, and choose <B>Redirect As</B> from the <B>Message</B> submenu of the drop-down menu.</P>

<P>•Set up a filter that uses the <B>Redirect To</B> filter action. See the sections <A HREF="eudo3v77.htm">Filtering Messages</A> and <A HREF="eudo6dir.htm">Filter Actions</A>.</P>

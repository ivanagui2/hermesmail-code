<p>Your query results are listed in the left half of the Directory Services window, in the <i>results list</i> (top view) and the <i>details pane</i> (bottom view). You can resize the two views relative to each other using the separator between them; drag the separator up or down.</p>

<p>The results list consists of one-line summaries of the "hits" or successful targets of your query. These are listed by four columns: <b>Name</b>, <b>Email</b>, <b>Phone</b>, and <b>Database</b>. Name indicates the username (or other name) of the target. Email is the email address of the target. Phone is the target’s telephone number. Database tells you in which of your selected databases the target was found.</p>

<p>Click a column header to sort the results list alphabetically (or numerically) by that column. Shift-click to sort in reverse order.</p>

<p>To resize the columns, drag the divider line to the right of the desired column to the left or right. Note that the columns resize dynamically during a query to accommodate the width of each target’s data.</p>

<p>The <b>Status</b> field displays the status of your query (such as <b>Ready</b>, <b>Connecting</b>, or <b>Getting Data</b>) and the number of items found as shown in your summary list. This number is updated dynamically until the query is complete or you stop it.</p>

<p>If the results list does not fit in the available viewing space, scroll bars appear to let you navigate through the remaining part of the list.</p>

<p>To view the details of a result in the details pane, select the result in the results list by clicking on it. The full data appears in the details pane. If nothing is selected in the results list, the details pane is blank. If multiple summaries are selected in the results list, the details pane lists the details for each item, with each item separated by a divider line.</p>

<p>To select multiple items in the results list, use the <b>Shift</b> key to select a continuous range, and use the <b>Ctrl</b> key to make nonconsecutive selections.</p>

<p>Scroll bars appear in the details pane if the displayed information cannot fit in the viewing space.</p>

<P>The Address Book is where you keep information about individuals or groups that you correspond with. Each entry in the Address Book includes a name for a person or group, their full email address (email addresses for groups), a full name, any contact information including both home and work information, other email addresses and information, and any notes. You can also use the Address Book to put names on the Recipient List, and to address a new message. </P>

<P>You can perform a search for an entry in your address book. With your address book open, press Ctrl+Shift+F or from the <B>Edit </B>menu, choose <B>Text</B>, then <B>Find Text</B>. In Find dialog, enter the nickname of the person you are searching for. That person’s file appears.</P>

<P>To open your Address Book, do the following:</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Address Book</B>, or press <B>Ctrl+L</B>. Or, if the Address Book is an inactive window in an open tabbed window group, click its tab. See <A HREF="eudo1pv7.htm">Window States and Tabbed Windows</A> for more details on tabbed windows.</P>

<P>All of the Address Book entries are kept in files. For example, you can show files for Business, Family, and Friends (Eudora Nicknames is the default file). You can show or hide the entries in a file by double-clicking the file. The icon shows an open or closed book, depending on whether the file is open or closed.</P>

<P>You can use the <B>View By</B> option to display the entries using any of the fields except the <B>Notes</B> field. For example, if you want to view the entries by nicknames, choose <B>View By: Nickname</B>. If you view by a field that doesn’t contain any data, the entry appears with &lt;&gt;.</P>

<P>You can also start typing in the list of entries, and the appropriate entry will be selected when you enter enough unique characters to identify it.</P>

<P>To page up and down in the list of entries, use the arrow keys. To resize the list, drag the divider.</P>

<P>To move the keyboard focus back and forth between the left and right sides of the Address Book, press <B>F6</B>.</P>

<P>To move quickly through the tabbed windows on the right side of the Address Book, use the <B>Ctrl+Tab</B>, <B>Ctrl+PgUp</B>, <B>Ctrl+PgDn</B>, <B>Ctrl+Home</B>, and <B>Ctrl+End</B> keys.</P>

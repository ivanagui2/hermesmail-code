<P>Eudora includes a built-in spelling checker that checks for misspellings in the Subject field of the header and the body of current message composition windows, text files, and signature files. It includes a built-in dictionary and also allows for the creation of a custom user dictionary. Additionally, it can be configured to ignore capitalized words, words with all capitals, words with numbers, and mixed-case words; to report doubled (repeated) words; and to suggest alternative spellings.</P>

<P><I>Note:Changes to the spelling options can be made in the <A HREF="eudo1ign.htm">Spell Checking Options Window</A> found in Options under the Tools Menu or by selecting <B>Options</B> from the <B>Check Spelling</B> dialog box.</I></P>

<P>See the "Sources" section in the online <I>Eudora User Manual</I> for information on how to get dictionaries for languages other than U.S. English.</P>

<P>To automatically check spelling  as you type, turn on the <B>Automatically as you type</B> option in the <A HREF="eudo1ign.htm">Spell Checking options window</A> . If this option is on, then when you send or queue a message, the message is checked for spelling errors. If you complete the spell-checking process, the message is automatically sent or queued. If you instead click <B>Cancel</B>, or leave spelling errors in the message, a dialog box appears asking you if you still want to send or queue the message. If you don’t want that dialog box to be displayed, turn off the <B>Warn me when sending/queueing message with misspellings</B> option (this can also be set in the <A HREF="eudo1ign.htm">Spell Checking options window</A> ).</P>

<P>To check the spelling of a current composition window, text file, or signature file, click the <B>Check Spelling</B> button in the main window toolbar or choose <B>Check Spelling</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu (<B>Ctrl+6</B>). If there are no misspellings, the "No misspellings found" alert appears.</P>

<P><I>Note:For an alternate way to check your spelling using the <B>Shift+Check Spelling</B> option, which lets you see all misspelled words at once and change only those you want to, see<A HREF="eudo9p7r.htm"> Automatic Spell Checking</A>.</I></P>

<P><I>Note:If text is selected, Eudora checks the spelling only of the selected text. Otherwise, it starts the spelling check from the beginning of the message body or text file, and checks the entire text.</I></P>

<P>If a misspelled, unknown, or repeated word is found, the Check Spelling dialog box appears with the word listed in the Unknown field.</P>

<P>To correct the misspelled word, either (1) type the correct spelling of the word in the Change To field (if it is not already there) and click the <B>Change</B> button, (2) select the correct word from the Suggestions list and click the <B>Change</B> button, or (3) double-click the correct word in the Suggestions list. The spelling checker then proceeds with the check. </P>

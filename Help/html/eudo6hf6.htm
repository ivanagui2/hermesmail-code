<P>You can set up central Address Book files on a server and configure Eudora clients so that they refer to the central files.</P>

<P>First, be sure the files are plain text, have a .<B>txt </B>extension, and are formatted as follows: One nickname on each line with the real addresses separated by commas, and one line for notes and info with the <B>Notes</B> text following the <B>Info</B> data. For example:</P>

<P>alias Wow joe@wow.com,lisa@wow.com,chris@wow.com<BR>
note Wow &lt;fax: 222.2223&gt;&lt;phone: 222.2222&gt;&lt;address:1234 Street&gt;<BR>
&lt;name:Wow Inc.&gt;My favorite company</P>

<P>Then, for each client application, add an <B>ExtraNicknameDirs </B>entry to the [Settings] section of the <B>Eudora.ini</B> file. This entry should be followed by the list of directories that contain Address Book files, separated by semicolons (;). Any Address Book files located in those directories are added to the Address Book. You need to exit and relaunch Eudora to see the new entries.</P>

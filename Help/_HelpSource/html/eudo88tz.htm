<h2><a name="filter_report_window"></a>Filter Report Window</h2>

<p>If the <b>Generate Filter Report</b> option is turned on in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000189">Getting Attention</a> options window found in Options under the Tools menu, HERMES generates a filter report. This report can be viewed in the Filter Report window found under the Tools menu.</p>

<p>To open the Filter Report window, do the following:</p>

<p>1. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Filter Report</b>. Or, if the Filter Report window is in a visible tabbed window, click its tab.</p>

<p>If filter report generation is enabled via the option mentioned above, then each time a filter operation is performed, HERMES adds the entry or entries to the Filter Report window and activates the window.</p>

<p>The Filter Report window displays three columns of data:</p>

<p>•<b>Mailbox</b> — Lists the names of the mailboxes into which messages have been filtered during the current HERMES session. Each listing represents one filter operation for that mailbox.</p>

<p>•<b>Messages</b> — For each mailbox listed in the <b>Mailbox</b> column, lists the number of messages filtered into that mailbox during the filter operation.</p>

<p>•<b>Time</b> — For each mailbox listed in the <b>Mailbox</b> column, lists the time that the messages were filtered into that mailbox during the filter operation.</p>

<p>By default, the entries in the window are sorted by time. However, you can click the column headings and sort the display by mailbox names (<b>Mailbox</b>) or by the number of messages filtered (<b>Messages</b>).</p>

<p><i>Note:Whenever new entries are added to the list, HERMES always appends them to the bottom of the list in order of arrival, ignoring the current sort order. Simply click a column heading to re-sort.</i></p>

<p>Select one or more entries in the list and double-click the selection, or press <b>Enter</b>, and HERMES opens the mailbox windows associated with those selections.</p>

<p>The Filter Report listing is a cumulative log of the filter actions for the <i>current HERMES session</i>. HERMES automatically clears the log when you quit the program.</p>

<p>Closing the Filter Report window <i>does not</i> erase the contents of the filter report, as it did in previous versions of HERMES. Only quitting HERMES erases this information.</p>

<P>A window is said to be in the <I>normal</I> state if it is restricted to the window work area of the main Eudora window and cannot be dragged out of the main window.</P>

<P>Normal windows can be moved around within the window work area. They can also be minimized and maximized to completely fill the visible window work area. When a normal window is maximized, its title bar partially blends with the main window title bar.</P>

<P>Normal windows can overlap other normal windows and are obscured by both docked and floating windows.</P>

<P>The title bar of a normal window contains the window-menu icon (far left) and three window buttons: minimize/restore, maximize/restore, and close.</P>

<P>A tool window in the normal state, whether alone or in a tabbed group, can be dragged out of the confines of the main Eudora window, but it must first be converted to a dockable or floating window. To perform this conversion, right-click the window’s border or tab, uncheck (turn off) <B>Float In Main Window</B> on the context menu (right-click), then select (turn on) <B>Allow Docking</B> on the menu.</P>

<P>A nontool window in the normal state, such as a mailbox window or a message window, can <I>never</I> be dragged out of the confines of the main Eudora window.</P>

<P>To convert a docked or floating window to a normal window, right-click the docked or floating window’s border or tab, and choose <B>Float In Main Window</B> from the context menu (right-click).</P>

<p>Enter the full name of the computer that receives your incoming mail. </p>

<p>For example, if your assigned login name is "justine," and the name of the computer where you receive email is <i>incoming.qualcomm.com</i> type only <i>incoming.qualcomm.com</i> in this field. (When you enter your server name here, it is made available in the incoming Mail Server field of other Options categories.) Then your full email address is <i>justine@incoming.qualcomm.com</i>.</p>

<p>Your incoming server is either a POP or IMAP server. A POP account is an account on a computer that runs a Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3 or POP) server. An IMAP account is an account on a computer that runs an Internet Message Access Protocol server. This is the account to which your email messages are delivered so that HERMES can find them and transfer them to your computer. You must have a POP or IMAP account to be able to receive mail with HERMES.  </p>

<p>Most likely, you receive your mail from a POP server; however, if you are using HERMES in an organization, please check with you system administrator to see what kind of server you are using for your incoming mail.</p>

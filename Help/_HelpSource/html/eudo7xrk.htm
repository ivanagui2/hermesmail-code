<h2><a name="introducing_esp"></a>Introducing ESP</h2>

<p>HERMES Sharing Protocol (ESP) is a HERMES feature that allows a group of people, called a share group, to collaborate and share a common set of files. ESP automatically gives each member of the share group a copy of those files, and when one of the members changes a file, it brings all the other members' copies up to date automatically. ESP also makes it easy for the members of a share group to send email messages to each other. Unlike other collaboration tools, ESP uses only email to keep everyone in sync on the shared files, so there's no need to maintain and administer a shared server. </p>

<p>ESP allows you to create and manage share groups within HERMES, on both Windows and Mac platforms. If you send and receive email through HERMES, you can belong to an ESP share group.</p>

<p>When you join an ESP group, you designate a shared folder on your hard drive. HERMES uses the shared folder to keep the most current copies of your group’s documents together. You and each member of your group have copies of the shared documents. When you or a member of your group adds, deletes, or updates a document, ESP automatically adds, deletes, or updates all copies of the document in all of the members’ shared folder.</p>

<p>You can use ESP for projects at work and for family members at home to help them stay in touch. For example, you can create a share group by inviting members of your family to share their most current photos with each other. When one member of the family adds a digitized photo to his or her shared folder, all members of the family can see it. It’s like maintaining a family album that can be shared with members of family no matter where they live. </p>

<p>When communicating between members of your group, email messages from the group members are automatically routed to the mailbox of your choice. However, you can assign only one mailbox per group.</p>

<p>You do ESP functions from the ESP Group window found on the Tools menu. These are the basic tasks in creating and maintaining a share group:</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Create a share group.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Assign the share group a mailbox in HERMES and shared folder on your hard drive, for example, your C:\ drive.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Invite members to join the share group.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Configure how ESP will update the shared folders.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Configure how your group members are notified of changes to the shared folder.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Maintain group membership by inviting or deleting members, or by synchronizing all shared folders.</p>

<p>However, you may be asked to join a share group. If so, answer the invitation and the you can create a new shared folder and mailbox. </p>

<p><b>Important:</b> You can only belong to a group on one computer. For example, you can use your home computer to set up a group for family photos, and you can use your work computer to set up a group for a work related project. However, you cannot use both your home and work computer to view your family photos in your family group. If you try to do that, one or both computers will miss some of the photos.</p>

<p>However, if you have two different email addresses, you can belong to a share group on more than one computer. If you check mail with one email address at work and a different address at home, you just need to invite yourself to the share group twice, once for each address. Once you’re in the group with one account, you can send an invitation to your other account yourself. ESP will treat your two accounts as two different share group members, and each will receive all the updates.</p>

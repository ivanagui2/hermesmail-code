<p>The Checking Mail Options determine how HERMES checks for and receives incoming mail messages sent to your principal email account, that is your dominant personality.</p>

<p>To display the Checking Mail options window, do the following:</p>

<p>1. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, select <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2. Click <b>Checking Mail</b>. The Checking Mail options window appears.</p>

<p>Listed below are field descriptions for Checking Mail:</p>

<p><b>Mail Server —</b>— This is the name of your incoming-mail server as entered in the Mail Server (Incoming) field of the Getting Started options. See the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000199">Getting Started</a><u> Options Window</u> for more details.</p>

<p><b>User Name</b> —— This is the login name you entered in the User Name field of the Getting Started options. See the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000199">Getting Started Options Window</a> section for more details.</p>

<p><b>Check for mail every _ minute(s) —</b>— If you enter a number greater than zero in this field, then at regular intervals, HERMES automatically checks your incoming mail server for new mail and transfers to your computer any mail addressed to your primary account. The number you enter here specifies the number of minutes between automatic mail checks. It’s a good idea to set this at no less than 15 minutes. Checking mail more frequently puts an unnecessary drain on your incoming mail server. This option only works when HERMES is running. Entering 0 in this field turns off automatic mail checking.</p>

<p><b>Don’t check without a network connection</b>—If this is selected, HERMES will not attempt to retrieve mail unless you are connected to a network. </p>

<p><b>Don’t check when using battery —</b>— If this is on and your computer is running on battery power, mail is not automatically checked even if automatic mail-checking is on (that is, the "Check for mail every _ minute(s)" field has a number greater than zero in it).</p>

<p><b>Send on check —</b>— If this is on, any messages that are queued in the Out mailbox are sent when a mail-check is performed, whether the mail check is automatic or manual. If this is off, messages queued in the Out box are not sent during a mail check.</p>

<p><b>Save password —</b>— If this is on, your password is remembered even if you quit and restart HERMES, so you’ll never be prompted to enter it. If this is off, you must enter your password each time you quit and restart HERMES. Only turn this option on if your computer is in a secure place.</p>

<p><b>Secure Sockets when Receiving—</b>—You can choose how you wish to use SSL when receiving messages by choosing one of the options in the SSL drop-down menu. The following are the SSL options when receiving mail.</p>

<p><b>Never</b>— Do not use SSL for server authentication and mail transfer security, even if SSL is available on the server. </p>

<p><b>If Available STARTTLS</b> (default)— Use SSL for server authentication and mail transfer security by having HERMES automatically invoke the STARTTLS command method to start SSL, that is, if the server supports STARTTLS. If your server doesn’t support STARTTLS, mail transfers will occur successfully, but they will not be secured with SSL.</p>

<p><b>Required, Alternate Port</b>— Use SSL for server authentication and mail transfer security by having HERMES automatically use the older style alternate port method for starting SSL. If your server does not support SSL on the appropriate ports, mail transfers will fail. </p>

<p><b>Required STARTTLS</b>— Use SSL for server authentication and mail transfer security by having HERMES automatically invoke the STARTTLS command method to start SSL. If your server does not support STARTTLS, mail transfers will fail. </p>

<p><i><b>Important.</b> If you use SSL and cannot make a connection when receiving or sending mail, you may need to check with your ISP to update any invalid SSL certificates. However, to override any issues with SSL when retrieving or sending mail, choose </i>Never <i>from the drop-down menu to make a successful connection.</i></p>

<p><b>Last SSL info—</b>—To display the most current information for an SSL connection between a server and HERMES since the last time you started HERMES, click<b> Last SSL info</b>. The HERMES SSL Connection Information Manager window appears with SLL and certificate information. </p>

<p><i><b>Caution:</b> If you display the SSL information windows, make certain you don’t change any of the field information unless you are familiar with SSL.</i></p>

<P>ESP manages group membership through a shared mailing list, allowing group members to share files and messages. ESP creates the mailing list through a series of processes, called invitations, ensuring that each member of the group has explicit knowledge of group membership by acknowledging and approving each new member.</P>

<P>To join an existing group, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Wait for an email message from one of the group members inviting you to join their group. The Join ESP Share Group dialog box automatically appears after Eudora is done receiving the email message.</P>

<P>2.To join the group, click <B>Join</B>. If you don’t want to join, click <B>Cancel</B>.</P>

<P>ESP prompts you to join the group by opening the New Group Wizard. Choose a folder to store your copies of the shared documents and a mailbox to receive messages associated with the group. See " <B>Error! Reference source not found.</B>"  on page <B>Error! Bookmark not defined.</B> for details.</P>

<P>ESP processes the invitation, adds you as a member of the group, and sends an RSVP message to the member who invited you to join. When the inviter's copy of ESP receives your acceptance, you'll be sent a membership update message which will add the other group members to your list.</P>

<P>Until you receive an introduction from another group member, ESP doesn’t associate those members with you as part of the group.</P>

<P>When all introduction messages are received and answered, you are a member of the group.</P>

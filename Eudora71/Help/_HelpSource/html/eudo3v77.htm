<p><i>Note. If you are using Eudora in Light mode, you may use only a few of the filter functions when filtering messages.</i></p>

<p>Many of the email management functions in Eudora can be done automatically using filters. For example, you can automatically reply to a request for information, transfer all the messages from your children into a Personal mailbox, and label all the messages from your customers as "Important."</p>

<p>A filter can be thought of as a personal organizer that takes your mail and does certain things to it that you specify. One kind of organizer might watch for particular mail from a mailing list and move it into a mailbox, open the message, and play a sound. Another might look for other kinds of mail and give it a label color, a high priority, and a new Subject line. You can create as many of these organizers as you like and give each of them from one to five instructions on what to do with your mail that fits a certain set of criteria, based on information in the header of the message and the message body.</p>

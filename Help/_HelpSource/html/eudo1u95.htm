<h2><a name="the_messaging_application_program_interface_mapi"></a>Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI)</h2>

<p>MAPI is an interface for sending email messages from any MAPI-compatible application, such as your word processor, spreadsheet, graphics application, and so forth.</p>

<p>MAPI-compatible applications have a <b>Send</b> or <b>Send Mail</b> option in the <b>File</b> menu. When you select the option, the HERMES MAPI server displays a new outgoing message with your current document attached. All you need to do is address the message, type any details you want to include in the body of the message, and click <b>Send </b>or<b> Queue</b>.</p>

<p>•To run the HERMES MAPI server, use the MAPI options window. To display the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-0000F9">MAPI options window</a>, choose <b>Options</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu and click MAPI.</p>

<p>You have several options in the MAPI options window for loading the HERMES MAPI server. You can set it to always run or to run only when HERMES is running, or you can specify that it never run. These three options open or exit the server as soon as you select them.</p>

<p><i>Note:When you are running the HERMES MAPI server, Microsoft Exchange will not work. If you need to use Exchange, turn off the HERMES server. </i></p>

<p><i>See the online User Manual for technical details on the HERMES MAPI server.</i></p>

<p>Also, you have several options for saving or deleting MAPI attachments. When you use MAPI to attach a file and send a message, that file is immediately copied into the Attach directory (or a directory you have specified). You can use the MAPI options to save those copies, delete them after sending their corresponding messages, or delete them after their messages are emptied from the trash.</p>

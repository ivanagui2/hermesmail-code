<p>Plug-ins are special add-ons that can be installed to add features to Eudora. For example, you could use a language conversion plug-in to translate a message to another language, a security plug-in to automatically secure a message, or a text manipulation plug-in to change lowercase to uppercase. Plug-ins interface to Eudora using the Extended Messaging Services Application Programming Interface (EMSAPI). </p>

<p>•To make <i>plugins</i> available to Eudora, put them in the <b>Plugins</b> directory in your Eudora Email directory, then restart Eudora. Depending on the plug-in type, it will be available in Eudora through the following methods:</p>

<p>-The <b>Message Plugins</b> submenu (in the <b>Edit</b> menu) typically includes <i>plugins</i> that are used to modify the text of a message. These are referred to as on-request <i>plugins</i>. Some samples of these types of <i>plugins</i> are available with Eudora: Sort, UpperLower, and Unwrap.</p>

<p>-Icons in the message window are typically for <i>plugins</i> that are used to manipulate messages as they are sent or when they are received. These are referred to as on-transmission and on-display <i>plugins</i>.</p>

<p>-The <b>Tools</b> menu typically includes <i>plugins</i> that are used to do tasks that are not directly related to Eudora functions. These are referred to as tools <i>plugins</i>.</p>

<p>-The <b>Attach [to New]</b> submenu (in the <b>Message</b> menu) typically includes <i>plugins</i> that are used to create and attach particular files to a message. These are referred to as attachment <i>plugins</i>.</p>

<p>-Plug-ins that are automatically used when a message is received are not available through the user interface.</p>

<p>•To see all of your currently installed <i>plugins</i>, choose <b>Message Plugins Settings</b> from the Special menu. If a plug-in has any settings options, you can use the <b>Settings</b> button to change them. </p>

<p>For information about available <i>plugins</i>, send email to &lt;eudora-rep@eudora.com&gt; or visit our web site www.eudora.com/central/plugins </p>

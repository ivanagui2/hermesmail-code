<h2><a name="adding_a_ph_database"></a>Adding a Ph Database</h2>

<p>Ph is an online, fully indexed, fast-access white-pages directory service developed and freely distributed by the Computer and Communications Services Office at the University of Illinois at Urbana.</p>

<p>To add a new Ph database, do the following: </p>

<p>1.In the <b>Protocols</b> list, click the <b>Ph</b> protocol to select it. </p>

<p>2.Click <b>New Database</b>. Or, just double-click <b>Ph</b> in the Protocols list. The New Database window, General panel, appears.</p>

<p>3.In the <b>General</b> panel, enter a descriptive name for the Ph server, its <b>Host Name</b> or IP address of the Ph server, and the <b>Port </b>in the respective fields. The default port for Ph is 105. Don’t change this port number unless you know for certain that the port number is not 105. </p>

<p>4.Select the <b>Attributes</b> tab to display the Attributes panel. The Attributes pane appears.</p>

<p>In the Attributes panel, you can add, edit, or remove attributes that display in the Results List (top-half of left window) and in the Details List (bottom-half of left window). </p>

<p><b>Results List</b></p>

<p>In the Results List, the data associated with the Ph attributes you name are displayed in the columns on the left pane of the Directory Services window. You do this by mapping attributes to one of the three special "Present As" field selections: <b>Name</b>, <b>Email(w)</b>, and <b>Phone(w)</b>. See step 5.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to display the data associated with the Ph attribute "Full_Name" in the column named "Name" in the Results List, add an attribute mapping for "Full_Name" with "Name" selected as the "Present As" value.</p>

<p><b>Details List</b></p>

<p>Any attribute name can be renamed before it appears in the Details List. This is done via the <b>Present As</b> field.  Simply replace the text in the Details List with alternate text.</p>

<p>For example, if your Ph server is configured to display an attribute called Full_Name but you want only Name to display, you need to map "Full_Name" to "Name" using the "Present As" field. Therefore, any Ph query you perform on that server would display the "Full_Name" data in the <b>Name</b> column in the Results List.</p>

<p>5.To add an attribute mapping to the attributes list, click <b>Add</b>. To edit an attribute mapping, click the attribute on the list and click <b>Edit</b>. Edit the attribute name. To remove an attribute mapping, click to select it and then click <b>Remove</b>. </p>

<p>6.When you are finished making entries or changes, click <b>OK</b>. The attributes are added to or changed in the database. </p>

<p>If you added a new database, the database is added to the Databases list with its checkbox.</p>

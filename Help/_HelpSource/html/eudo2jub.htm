<h2><a name="checking_for_mail_with_special_server_instructions"></a>Checking for Mail with Special Server Instructions</h2>

<p>To check your mail and give special transfer and storage instructions to the POP server, do the following:</p>

<p>1. Hold down the Shift key and from the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Check Mail</b>. The <b>Mail Transfer Options </b>dialog box appears. </p>

<p>2. Set the options you want and click <b>OK</b> to continue checking for mail.</p>

<p>The mail transfer options are described below.</p>

<p><b>Retrieve new mail</b></p>

<p>Transfer your new mail from the POP server to your computer.</p>

<p><b>Send queued messages</b></p>

<p>Send all the queued messages (marked "Q") in your Out mailbox.</p>

<p><b>Delete messages marked for deletion</b></p>

<p>Delete from the POP server the messages that are marked <b>Delete</b> in Eudora. This is for messages that were retrieved only in part, either with the <b>Leave mail on server</b> or <b>Skip messages over _ K in size </b>options (in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000192">Incoming Mail Options Window</a> for your main account or the Account Settings dialog for your alternate personalities), or with the <b>Fetch all message headers to In mailbox</b> option (in the Mail Transfer options window).</p>

<p><b>Retrieve messages marked for retrieval</b></p>

<p>Retrieve from the POP server the messages that are marked <b>Fetch</b> or <b>Fetch then Delete</b> in Eudora. This is for messages that were retrieved only in part, either with the <b>Leave mail on server</b> or <b>Skip messages over _ K in size </b>options (in the Incoming Mail options window for your main account or the Account Settings dialog for your alternate personalities), or with the <b>Fetch all message headers to In mailbox</b> option (in the Mail Transfer options window).</p>

<p><i>Note:To mark a message <b>Fetch</b>,<b> Delete</b>, or<b> Fetch then Delete, </b>either click the buttons in the incoming message window, or select an option from the Server Status drop-down of the message summary.</i></p>

<p><b>Delete all messages that have been retrieved</b></p>

<p>Delete from the POP server all of the messages that have already been transferred to the computer you are on.</p>

<p><b>Delete all messages on server</b></p>

<p>Delete <i>all of your messages</i> from the POP server. <b>Note:</b> Be absolutely sure this is what you want to do, because there is no way to undo it!</p>

<p><b>Fetch all message headers to In mailbox</b></p>

<p>Retrieve from the POP server the header and the first few lines of every new message. If you select this option, the messages are not filtered. Set the <b>Server Status</b> in the message summaries to specify what you want to do with the messages the next time you check mail.</p>

<p><i><b>Important:</b>If you delete the message header, and you have the <b>Delete from server when emptied from Trash</b> option on in either the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000192">Incoming Mail Options Window</a> for your main account, or the Account Settings dialog for an alternate account, the message is gone completely from Eudora and the POP server.</i></p>

<p><b>How should checking/sending be performed</b></p>

<p>If you have multiple personalities, you can check or send mail based on the options on the left of the Mail Transfer options window (turn on <b>Using options at left</b>), or as specified in the Incoming Mail options window, for your dominant account only, or in the Account Settings dialog (accessed from the Personalities window), for any of your personalities (turn on <b>Normally</b>). You can also specify the personalities that you want to check or send with this mail transfer. Hold down the Shift key to select multiple personalities in sequence, or the Ctrl key to select them out of sequence.</p>

<p><i>Note:Another way to check mail for multiple personalities, regardless of your settings elsewhere, is to open the Personalities window, select your desired personalities, right-click the selection, and choose <b>Check Mail</b> from the drop-down menu.</i></p>

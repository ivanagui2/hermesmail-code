<p>If the Generate Filter Report option is turned on in Getting Attention options panel found in Options under the Tools menu. So when filters are used, Eudora generates a filter report. This report can be viewed in the Filter Report window found under the Tools menu.</p>

<p>If filter report generation is enabled via the option mentioned above, then each time a filter operation is performed, Eudora adds the entry or entries to the Filter Report window and activates the window.</p>

<p>The Filter Report window displays three columns of data:</p>

<p>•<b>Mailbox </b>— Lists the names of the mailboxes into which messages have been filtered during the current Eudora session. Each listing represents one filter operation for that mailbox.</p>

<p>•<b>Messages</b> — For each mailbox listed in the Mailbox column, lists the number of messages filtered into that mailbox during the filter operation.</p>

<p>•<b>Time</b> — For each mailbox listed in the Mailbox column, lists the time that the messages were filtered into that mailbox during the filter operation.</p>

<p>By default, the entries in the window are sorted by time. However, you can click the column headings and sort the display by mailbox names (Mailbox) or by the number of messages filtered (Messages).</p>

<p><i>Note:Whenever new entries are added to the list, Eudora always appends them to the bottom of the list in order of arrival, ignoring the current sort order. Simply click a column heading to re-sort.</i></p>

<p>Select one or more entries in the list and double-click the selection, or press Enter, and Eudora opens the mailbox windows associated with those selections.</p>

<p>The Filter Report listing is a cumulative log of the filter actions for the <i>current Eudora session</i>. Eudora automatically clears the log when you quit the program.</p>

<p>Closing the Filter Report window <i>does not</i> erase the contents of the filter report, as it did in previous versions of Eudora. Only quitting Eudora erases this information.</p>

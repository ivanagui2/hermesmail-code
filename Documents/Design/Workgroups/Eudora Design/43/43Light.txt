1.0 4.3 Freeware Featureset
	1.1 Feature Removal Rationale
		1.1.1 Features removed had to have a definite “upsell” value.
		1.1.2 Freeware needs enough features to be useful in its own right.
		1.1.3 Engineering/Marketing/Support/Whatever headaches due to feature removal should be minimized.
	1.2 Removal Notes
		1.2.1 4.3 Freeware will have all features of 4.3 Payware/Adware, except those listed below.
		1.2.2 It is not a goal to have the removed features completely hidden.  It is perfectly acceptable (perhaps desireable) to dim the feature and add explanatory text/icon/tooltip that says “This feature is available only to Paid or Select users.”

<H2><A NAME="window_context_menu"></A>Window Context Menu</H2>

<P>If you right-click the tab or border of a single tool window, or on any tab or the border of a tabbed window, Eudora displays a context menu containing window-management commands.</P>

<P>The commands on the context menu are described below.</P>

<P>Note that if you right-click in the interior of some tool windows, and sometimes on an item in the window itself, these window-management commands appear at the bottom of the context menu (right-click) specific to that tool window. </P>

<P><B>Tab Location</B></P>

<P>This submenu is always available on the window context menu. It lets you change the location of the tabs in a tabbed window, and lets you show and hide the tab in a single-tabbed window.</P>

<P>By default, Eudora places window tabs at the bottom of a tabbed window. Choose <B>Top</B>, <B>Bottom</B>, <B>Left</B>, or <B>Right</B> from this submenu to move the tabs to the top of the tabbed window, the bottom, or the left or right side. Eudora places a bullet (radio button) next to the current tab location selection.</P>

<P>Changing tab locations can sometimes increase the visible space within a tabbed window. For example, a short-and-wide tabbed window (one docked horizontally) might show more content if you move the tabs to the right side.</P>

<P><B>Show Single Tab</B> is available in a single-tabbed window, and lets you show or hide the tab. A checkmark next to the command indicates that the tab is shown (the default). This command is not available in a tabbed window containing two or more tabs; you cannot hide the tabs in such a window. </P>

<P><B>Allow Docking</B></P>

<P>This command controls the ability to dock of floating and docked windows. It is available only when the <B>Float In Main Window</B> command is turned off (unchecked). It is <I>not</I> available for normal windows (that is, when <B>Float In Main Window</B> is turned on).</P>

<P>A checkmark next to the command indicates that it is on.</P>

<P>When this command is on for a docked or floating window, the window can be docked to any edge of the main Eudora window.</P>

<P>When <B>Allow Docking</B> is turned off for a docked window, the window is converted to a floating window and cannot be redocked. When the command is turned off for a floating window, the window cannot be docked.</P>

<P>Even with <B>Allow Docking</B> on, you can hold down the <B>Ctrl</B> key while dragging a docked or floating window to suspend its ability to dock until you release the key. </P>

<P><B>Hide</B></P>

<P>This command is always available on the context menu.</P>

<P>Choose <B>Hide</B> to hide (close) the tool window or tabbed window. <B>Hide</B> performs the same function as the <B>Close</B> command (<B>Ctrl+F4</B>) on the standard MS Windows window context menu (right-click).</P>

<P>Note, however, that when you hide or close a tool window, its content, state, and position are all preserved. And when you hide or close a tabbed window, the content, state, and position of all member windows are preserved. Thus, if you hide and redisplay a floating tabbed window, the window floats in its same position.</P>

<P>If you attempt to hide or close a tool window that contains unsaved changes, or a tabbed window in which the active window contains unsaved changes, Eudora asks you if you want to save your changes.</P>

<P>To redisplay a tool window after you’ve hidden it, select it from the <B>Tools</B> menu. To redisplay a tabbed window after you’ve hidden it, select one of its member windows from the <B>Tools</B> menu. The tabbed window redisplays with the selected window active. You can use keyboard shortcuts to redisplay hidden tool or tabbed windows where appropriate. </P>

<H2>Float In Main Window</H2>

<P>This command is always available on the context menu (right-click).</P>

<P>Turning this command on (indicated by a checkmark next to the command) converts a docked or floating window to a normal window. Turning this command off converts a normal window to a docked or floating window.</P>

<P>Note that the availability of the <B>Allow Docking</B> command depends on the state of this command. When <B>Float In Main Window</B> is turned on (checked), <B>Allow Docking</B> is <I>unavailable</I> (the window is normal). When <B>Float In Main Window</B> is turned off, <B>Allow Docking</B> is available. </P>

<H2><A NAME="using_the_eudora_taskbar"></A>Using the Eudora Taskbar</H2>

<P>The Eudora taskbar appears along the bottom edge of the window work area in the main Eudora window, and normally shows the QUALCOMM logo at the right.</P>

<P>The Eudora taskbar displays a button for each normal Eudora window that is open or minimized. The taskbar provides a convenient way to switch between normal windows by clicking buttons, without having to display the different windows from the Window menu.</P>

<P>The Eudora taskbar is modeled after the Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0 system taskbars, which usually appear at the bottom of the screen, but there are important differences, noted below.</P>

<P>To show or hide the Eudora taskbar, do the following: </P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Options</B> to open the Options dialog box. </P>

<P>2. Scroll and select <B>Display</B>.  The <A HREF="eudo6cs7.htm">Display options window</A> appears.</P>

<P>3. Check or uncheck the <B>Show MDI task bar</B> box to turn the option on or off.</P>

<P>Any <I>normal</I> Eudora window that is open or minimized is represented by a button on the taskbar. This includes composition messages, received messages, mailbox windows, and any tool windows or tabbed windows that are in the normal state. Any open tool or tabbed windows that are in the docked or floating state are <I>not</I> represented as buttons on the taskbar.</P>

<P>If a tabbed window is represented by a button on the taskbar, the button shows the name and icon associated with the active tool window in that tabbed window.</P>

<P>Click a taskbar button to make that normal window active. The window comes to the front of the stack of all normal Eudora windows.</P>

<P>If you right-click a taskbar button, the standard Windows context menu displays, letting you restore, minimize, maximize, or close that normal window.</P>

<P>If you right-click an exposed area of the taskbar (not on a button), the standard Eudora context menu displays.</P>

<P>If you drag an object over a taskbar button and pause for several seconds, Eudora activates the normal window associated with that button. For a tabbed window, Eudora activates the tabbed window with the indicated window active. You can then complete the drag and drop operation into the normal window. For a tabbed window, you can further pause the pointer over one of the inactive window tabs, and that window becomes active and you can complete the drop.</P>

<P>Each taskbar button displays both the window icon and the window title of the normal window. If there is not enough room to display the entire title, Eudora truncates the title and places an ellipsis (...) to indicate the truncation. If you pause the mouse pointer over such a button, Eudora displays the entire window title in a tooltip.</P>

<P>If you have many normal windows open or minimized, the taskbar buttons shrink so that all buttons are visible. When the bar gets sufficiently crowded, the QUALCOMM logo is hidden to make room.</P>

<P>Note that, unlike with the Windows 95/98/ME/2000 and Windows NT 4.0 taskbars, you cannot move the Eudora taskbar to another edge of the main Eudora window; it always stays at the bottom of the window work area. You also cannot resize the taskbar as a separate item. It resizes automatically, however, when you resize the main Eudora window.</P>

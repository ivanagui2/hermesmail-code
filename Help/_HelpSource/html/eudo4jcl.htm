<h2><a name="window_context_menu"></a>Window Context Menu</h2>

<p>If you right-click the tab or border of a single tool window, or on any tab or the border of a tabbed window, HERMES displays a context menu containing window-management commands.</p>

<p>The commands on the context menu are described below.</p>

<p>Note that if you right-click in the interior of some tool windows, and sometimes on an item in the window itself, these window-management commands appear at the bottom of the context menu (right-click) specific to that tool window. </p>

<p><b>Tab Location</b></p>

<p>This submenu is always available on the window context menu. It lets you change the location of the tabs in a tabbed window, and lets you show and hide the tab in a single-tabbed window.</p>

<p>By default, HERMES places window tabs at the bottom of a tabbed window. Choose <b>Top</b>, <b>Bottom</b>, <b>Left</b>, or <b>Right</b> from this submenu to move the tabs to the top of the tabbed window, the bottom, or the left or right side. HERMES places a bullet (radio button) next to the current tab location selection.</p>

<p>Changing tab locations can sometimes increase the visible space within a tabbed window. For example, a short-and-wide tabbed window (one docked horizontally) might show more content if you move the tabs to the right side.</p>

<p><b>Show Single Tab</b> is available in a single-tabbed window, and lets you show or hide the tab. A checkmark next to the command indicates that the tab is shown (the default). This command is not available in a tabbed window containing two or more tabs; you cannot hide the tabs in such a window. </p>

<p><b>Allow Docking</b></p>

<p>This command controls the ability to dock of floating and docked windows. It is available only when the <b>Float In Main Window</b> command is turned off (unchecked). It is <i>not</i> available for normal windows (that is, when <b>Float In Main Window</b> is turned on).</p>

<p>A checkmark next to the command indicates that it is on.</p>

<p>When this command is on for a docked or floating window, the window can be docked to any edge of the main HERMES window.</p>

<p>When <b>Allow Docking</b> is turned off for a docked window, the window is converted to a floating window and cannot be redocked. When the command is turned off for a floating window, the window cannot be docked.</p>

<p>Even with <b>Allow Docking</b> on, you can hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key while dragging a docked or floating window to suspend its ability to dock until you release the key. </p>

<p><b>Hide</b></p>

<p>This command is always available on the context menu.</p>

<p>Choose <b>Hide</b> to hide (close) the tool window or tabbed window. <b>Hide</b> performs the same function as the <b>Close</b> command (<b>Ctrl+F4</b>) on the standard MS Windows window context menu (right-click).</p>

<p>Note, however, that when you hide or close a tool window, its content, state, and position are all preserved. And when you hide or close a tabbed window, the content, state, and position of all member windows are preserved. Thus, if you hide and redisplay a floating tabbed window, the window floats in its same position.</p>

<p>If you attempt to hide or close a tool window that contains unsaved changes, or a tabbed window in which the active window contains unsaved changes, HERMES asks you if you want to save your changes.</p>

<p>To redisplay a tool window after you’ve hidden it, select it from the <b>Tools</b> menu. To redisplay a tabbed window after you’ve hidden it, select one of its member windows from the <b>Tools</b> menu. The tabbed window redisplays with the selected window active. You can use keyboard shortcuts to redisplay hidden tool or tabbed windows where appropriate. </p>

<h2>Float In Main Window</h2>

<p>This command is always available on the context menu (right-click).</p>

<p>Turning this command on (indicated by a checkmark next to the command) converts a docked or floating window to a normal window. Turning this command off converts a normal window to a docked or floating window.</p>

<p>Note that the availability of the <b>Allow Docking</b> command depends on the state of this command. When <b>Float In Main Window</b> is turned on (checked), <b>Allow Docking</b> is <i>unavailable</i> (the window is normal). When <b>Float In Main Window</b> is turned off, <b>Allow Docking</b> is available. </p>

SMTP Auth
	Preferences
		Even when AUTH is offered by the SMTP server, the user may not wish to do it.  AUTH may not be required, and be simply a bother, or AUTH may be broken and actively harmful.
		AUTH_ALLOWED - the user is willing to do auth (default ON?)
		AUTH_REQUIRED - the user wants/needs to be asked for password (default OFF)
		Username and password will be POP username and password for now.  May be reasonable to re-claim dialup username and password (by preference) in the future.
	Algorithms
		Before sending:
			if AUTH_ALLOWED && AUTH_REQUIRED
  get user’s password
		During SMTP introductions
			if AUTH_ALLOWED && server offers AUTH && we have a password
  if auth attempt fails && AUTH_REQUIRED
    send fails
    password invalidated
		During any SMTP command
			if command returns 505
  if AUTH_ALLOWED
    set AUTH_REQUIRED
  send fails
		After SMTP session
			if send failed with 505 && !AUTH_ALLOWED
  Ask user if they want to turn on AUTH_ALLOWED
  if user wants to
    set AUTH_ALLOWED
    set AUTH_REQUIRED

	Implementor’s Notes
		Mac (Steve Dorner)
			Had to change base64 encoder to not insert linebreaks to do CRAM-MD5 properly for SMTP
			The base64 response is a base64 of the username, a space, and the hex-encoded digest, so it’s “double-encoded” which seemed odd to me, but that’s how it is.

<P>With the <B>Finish Address Book Entry</B> command, you can enter a unique portion of a nickname in the <B>To</B>, <B>Cc</B>, or <B>Bcc</B> fields of a message, then from the <B>Edit</B> menu, choose <B>Finish Address Book Entry</B>, and the nickname will be completed for you. You must enter the characters in the nickname that make it unique, or Eudora will not know which nickname to use. For example, if you have two nicknames, joan and john, you would have to enter "joa" or "joh" for Eudora to complete them.</P>

<P>To insert the real addresses for the entry, instead of the nickname, hold down the <B>Shift</B> key and from the <B>Edit</B> menu, choose <B>Finish Address Book Entry</B>. To set this to happen all the time, turn on the <B>Automatically expand nicknames</B> option in the <A HREF="eudo8nuf.htm">Miscellaneous options window</A> found in Options under the Tools menu.</P>

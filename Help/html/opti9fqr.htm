<P>After setting up your filter information, click this button to both create your filter and also open the Filters window so that you can add additional information to your new filter and make it more powerful or just change it. The filter is added to the bottom of your filters list and is immediately available in the form in which it was set up in the Make Filter dialog box. Any changes you make in the Filters window must be saved before they become effective. </P>

<P>Use the shared folder like any folder in Windows by adding, modifying, or deleting files as needed.</P>

<P>To open the shared folder, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>ESP</B> <B>Groups</B>.</P>

<P>2.In the left column, choose the name of the group you want to open and click <B>Open Folder</B>. The Save Changes dialog box opens if you have any unsaved changes to the shared folder. If not, the shared folder opens, allowing you to access its files.</P>

<P>ESP periodically scans the folder for changes, according to your settings, and sends the updated files to other group members. </P>

<P>3.To update the shared folder of another group member manually, choose the member from the Users dialog box and click <B>Sync Folder</B>. This sends the entire contents of the shared folder to the selected member.</P>

<P>As ESP receives periodic changes to the shared folder from other users, it incorporates the changes according to the settings you chose for the group (for example, with or without notification, and with or without archiving).</P>

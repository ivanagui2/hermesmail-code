<p>Eudora lets you look individuals up on the Internet, within your company, and in your Eudora Address Book (if you have one set up) using four directory service protocols: Ph, Finger, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), and Eudora Address Book.</p>

<p>The directory service protocols available to you for your search are listed in the Protocols section of the window. The Protocols section of the Directory Services window lists the directory service protocols available to you that you can use when creating and modifying databases for looking up individuals via these services.</p>

<p><i>Note:The Eudora Address Book protocol does not appear in the list until you have created an Address Book in Eudora.</i></p>

<p>To sort the protocols alphabetically, click the column heading (Registered Drivers). Shift-click the column heading to sort in reverse order.</p>

<p>You can resize the column by dragging the divider line to the right of the column heading to the left or right.</p>

<p>The databases you can use to look up your target individual are listed in the Databases list. The<b> </b>Databases section of the Directory Services window lists the databases that are available to you for searching for individuals over the Internet, within your company, or in your Address Book (if one is set up).</p>

<p>Eudora comes with these servers already configured by default:</p>

<p>•ldap.bigfoot.com</p>

<p>•ldap.switchboard.com</p>

<p>•ldap.whowhere.com</p>

<p>•ldap.infospace.com</p>

<p>•ldapbiz.infospace.com</p>

<p>•ldap.four11.com</p>

<p>•Eudora Nicknames [or the name of your nicknames file; this last item appears only if you have a Eudora Address Book set up]</p>

<p>You can modify or delete these databases, and you can also create new databases and modify and delete them. </p>

<p>You use the databases in this list to perform your lookup queries. To perform a query, you must first select one or more databases in the list. To select a database, click the checkbox to the left of the database name, until a checkmark appears in the box. If no databases are selected, you cannot perform a query.</p>

<p>You can select multiple databases to perform a query, and you can mix protocols.</p>

<p>Click a column heading to sort this list by that column, alphabetically. Shift-click the column heading to sort in reverse order.</p>

<p>To look someone up on the Internet, within your company, or in your Eudora Address Book, do the following:</p>

<p>1.In the Databases list, select the database(s) you want to search in your query.</p>

<p>To select a database, click the checkbox to the left of the database until a checkmark appears in the box. You can select multiple databases, and you can use multiple protocols. You must select at least one database in the list in order for Eudora to perform the query. </p>

<p><i>Note: Eudora remembers which databases you’ve selected when you quit and restart the    </i></p>

<p><i>program.</i></p>

<p>3.In the <b>Query</b> field, type a text string you want to search against.</p>

<p>If one or more of your selected databases use a protocol other than Ph, your entry in this field will always be interpreted as a name. If you only have Ph servers selected as your databases, you can enter any commands that Ph will interpret.</p>

<p>4.After you’ve typed the text, start the query by pressing <b>Enter</b> or clicking the <b>Start </b>button.</p>

<p>The query begins, and the Start button changes to Stop.</p>

<p>5.To stop the query before it is completed, click the <b>Stop</b> button.</p>

<p>When the query is completed, or if you click Stop to cancel the query, the Stop button changes back to Start.</p>

<p>To resize columns, position the mouse pointer over the divider line to the right of the desired column, and drag the line to the left or right.</p>

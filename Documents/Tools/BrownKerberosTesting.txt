Configuring Eudora to connect to Brown's mail server:

Create a new personality with the following settings:

Login Name: Test_User03
Incoming Server: postoffice.brown.edu
Configuration: IMAP
Authentication Style: Kerberos
IMAP Port: 1143


Actually connecting:

- Go to Leash, and connect to Brown (Using the Get Ticket menu item or button)
- Enter Test_User03 as your username, tu123ut as the password.
- Leash will display a ticket for Brown.


Notes:

Unfortunately, all versions of Eudora require you to first connect manually with KClient.  Future versions of Windows Eudora
should use the KClient API, and avoid this issue.

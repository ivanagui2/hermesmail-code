<P>Any file can be attached to and sent with a Eudora message. Most of the time, an attached document functions like a "rider" to the email message and does not appear within the message text. Instead, the name of the document appears automatically in the <B>Attached</B> field of the message header.</P>

<P>To attach a file to an outgoing message, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Message</B> menu, choose <B>Attach File [to New Message]</B>. The Attach File dialog box appears. </P>

<P>2. Locate the file you want, select it, and click the <B>Open</B> button to attach the document to the current message or to open a new message with the file attached. You can add as many attachments as you want to a message, one at a time.</P>

<P>You can also drag one or more files from either the Desktop or the File Browser window onto the message window to attach them. (See <A HREF="eudo3z1z.htm">File Browser Window</A>.)</P>

<P>To detach an attached document before the message is sent, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Select the document in the <B>Attached</B> field.</P>

<P>2. Press either the <B>Backspace</B> key or the <B>Delete</B> key.</P>

<P>When the message is sent, if the chosen document is not a plain text (ASCII) file, it is encoded in the selected attachment type. This allows you to send any kind of document through the mail, even applications. Encoding options for attachments are <A HREF="eudo1sx1.htm">MIME</A>, <A HREF="eudo8188.htm">BinHex</A> and <A HREF="eudo3e91.htm">Uuencode</A>.</P>

<P>If the document is an ASCII file, you can put it in the body of the by turning on the <B>Put text attachments in body of message</B> option in the Attachments options window (under Options from the Tool menu). The toolbar button applies to the current outgoing message; the Attachments option applies to all outgoing messages.</P>

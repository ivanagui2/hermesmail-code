<p>9.To migrate your email account, click <b>Next</b>. Eudora transfers all settings including personalities, incoming and outgoing server names, real name, return name, and login name. </p>

<p><i>Note: It may take </i>a<i> long time for the migration to occur depending on how much mail, the complexity of your settings, and the size of your address book that you’re importing into Eudora. Also, if during the migration, the process stops because of a corrupt message. You must go into your Netscape Messenger or Microsoft Outlook and delete the corrupt message to resume the migration.</i></p>

<p><i>Note:When the migration is occurring, notice in the Mailbox window that a mailbox tree begins to form. For example, you will see the folder "Outlook" and all its mailboxes listed underneath. A plus sign (+) next to the folder name indicates that other folders/mailboxes are contained within this folder.</i></p>

<P>The Attachments options determine how Eudora sends and receives file attachments.</P>

<P>To display the Attachments options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Attachments</B>. The Attachments options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Attachments:</P>

<P><B>Encoding method —</B>— This specifies what default encoding method to use for attached documents: MIME, BinHex, or Uuencode. To change the method for just the current message, use the Attachment Type drop-down menu in the outgoing message window. For details, see the section "Attaching a File to a Message."</P>

<P><B>Put text attachments in body of message —</B>— If this is on, Eudora puts any plain-text attachment you send directly within the message body, as if it were typed in manually.</P>

<P><B>Receive MIME digest as a mailbox attachment—</B>—Turn this on if you want Eudora to create a mailbox specifically for email messages from a mailing list that supports MIME digest.</P>

<P><B>Attachment directory —</B>— This specifies what directory to put incoming attachments into. To specify a folder, single-click the folder name. A dialog box appears prompting you to select a folder. The default directory is the Attach sub-directory off of your Eudora directory.</P>

<P><B>Delete attachments when emptying Trash —</B>— If this is on, Eudora automatically deletes an attachment received with a message when that message is deleted from your system, that is, when the message is emptied from the Trash. The attachment must still be in the folder defined as the Attachments Folder. If you want to save an attachment but delete the message, move the attachment to another folder or turn this option off.</P>

<P><B>Delete automatic attachments —</B>— This specifies how to handle attachments to automatically generated messages, such as is created with the Insert System Configuration command.</P>

<P><B>Never</B> —— If this is on, automatic attachments are never deleted from the attachment directory.</P>

<P><B>After sending message —</B>— If this is on, automatic attachments are deleted from the attachment directory when their corresponding messages are sent.</P>

<P><B>When message emptied from Trash —</B>— If this is on, automatic attachments are deleted from the attachment directory when their corresponding messages are emptied from the trash.</P>

<h2><a name="mood_watch_options_window"></a>MoodWatch Options Window</h2>

<p>In the Mood Watch options window, you can determine at what level you wish your messages to be monitored before a warning appears telling you that, perhaps, your message content may be offensive to your recipient. Also, you can set Mood Watch to monitor incoming and stored messages for offensive content. You can also set Eudora to hold messages that contain offensive text for ten minutes before you send them. </p>

<p>If you don't want to use Mood Watch at all, you can turn it off in this dialog. Also, you can choose if you want to use Mood Watch for incoming messages only, outgoing messages only, or both.</p>

<p>To display the Extra Warnings settings dialog, do the following.</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Options</b>.</p>

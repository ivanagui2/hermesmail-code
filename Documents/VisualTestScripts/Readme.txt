Thanks to everyone who helped with the writing of this book,
especially Bill Greenrose, Yuri Serebriany, Arthur Jaarsma
and Jaek Smith.

In addition thanks to everyone who corrected my spelling errors
and gave me grammer lessons. 

Thank you Tom Arnold for including this in your new
book.  I've made very few changes to the text of the
book but I've added several functions to the GenUtil
and GenAPI include files.

<p>The Auto-Completion options determine how you will use the name auto-completion feature to complete names and email addresses in the To, Cc and Bcc fields on the message headers of your outgoing messages. HERMES completes the names by looking for the names in either your history file or address book. </p>

<p>To display the Auto-Completion options window, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools </b>menu, choose <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2.Scroll and click <b>Auto-Completion</b>. The Auto-Completion options window appears.</p>

<p>Listed below are the field descriptions for Auto-completion.</p>

<p><b>History File—</b>Select to auto-complete names from your history file in the To, Cc, and Bcc fields in the message header. Deselect to not display names and email addresses from your history file in the drop-down name list. </p>

<p>The history file consists of names and email addresses that appear in the To and Cc, fields in the messages you send, reply to, or forward. </p>

<p><b>Address Book—</b>Select to auto-complete nicknames you’ve previously set up in your address book in the To, Cc, and Bcc fields in the message header. Deselect to not display nicknames from your address book in the drop-down name list.</p>

<p><b>Plug-in Addresses—</b>Select this option to make available the email addresses stored elsewhere in HERMES, for example in ESP.</p>

<p><b>Don’t auto-complete, just list matches—</b>Turn this option on if you don’t want HERMES to auto-complete your email address as you type it. If you choose this option, you need to just type one letter, and all email addresses that start with that letter from your address book and history list appear in the drop-down name list for you to choose from.</p>

<p><b>Use drop down list for completion choices—</b>Select to display the drop-down name list when you begin to type a name in the To, Cc, or Bcc fields. Deselect to not display the drop-down name list.</p>

<p><b>Time to wait before popping up Auto-Completion box (Milliseconds)—</b>Enter the number of milliseconds you want HERMES to wait before displaying the window containing the address book and history file choice entries. The larger the number you enter, the longer the wait. If you enter 0, the window will display immediately.  </p>

<p><b>Maximum number of entries to keep in history:—</b>Enter the number of names you want to keep in your history file at any given time. As you add names, the old entries are removed leaving the amount of names to equal the number entered here. </p>

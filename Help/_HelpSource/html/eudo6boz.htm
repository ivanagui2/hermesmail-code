<h2><a name="tabbed_windows"></a>Tabbed Windows</h2>

<p>A <i>tabbed window</i> is a collection of windows combined into one window; that is, windows accessed from the Tools menu. Each tool window in the tabbed window has its own <i>window tab</i>.</p>

<p>A window tab has two purposes: </p>

<p><font face="Symbol">·</font>It lets you bring the window to the front of the group to display it (by clicking the tab). </p>

<p><font face="Symbol">·</font>It serves as a "drag handle" that lets you drag the window from one tabbed window to another, so that you can reorganize your tabbed windows and create new tabbed windows.</p>

<p>Only tool windows are accessible from the <b>Tools</b> menu except for Options and are capable of being combined into a tabbed window. All other windows in HERMES, particularly mailbox windows and message windows, are <i>not</i> capable of being combined into a tabbed window.</p>

<p>A tabbed window can be in any of the three window states, normal, docked, or floating, and you can convert a tabbed window from any state to any other state.</p>

<p>If a tabbed window shows a title bar, the title in the bar is the name of the active window in the group.</p>

<p>With the combined windows, you are able to change the order of the tabbed windows. You can even move a tabbed window between two main windows. To move a tabbed window to the front of the list (the topmost is always displayed), drag and drop the tab to the far-left of the tabbed window group. As you drag the tabbed window, you will see an outline of the action of moving the tabbed window. When you see the long, vertical up arrow, you can insert the window into the new position.  </p>

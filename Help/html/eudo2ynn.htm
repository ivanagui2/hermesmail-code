<P>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)</P>

<P><B>Adding Toolbar Buttons</B></P>

<P>To add buttons to the main toolbar, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Right-click anywhere on the toolbar, even on a button, to display the drop-down menu. </P>

<P>2.From the drop-down menu, choose <B>Customize</B>. The Customize toolbar window appears.<BR>
The Customize window contains six tabbed panels: <B>General</B>, <B>Mailboxes</B>, <B>Plugins</B>, <B>Recipients</B>, <B>Stationery</B>, and <B>Personalities</B>. Each of these panels lets you add toolbar buttons for functions related to the tab title.</P>

<P><I>Note: The procedures for adding a toolbar button from each panel are similar. </I></P>

<P>3.In each panel, choose an item from the categories list on the left, and the corresponding button icons for that category are shown in the Buttons section on the right. </P>

<P>4.Click to select one of the button icons and view a description of the button’s function in the <B>Description</B> field at the bottom of the panel. These descriptions also appear in the status bar of the main Eudora window if the bar is currently displayed when you position the mouse pointer over the button icon. In this case, you don’t have to click the button.</P>

<P><I>Note:In these button descriptions, any instruction to hold down the Shift key means to do so when you are actually using the button from the toolbar, not when you are adding the button to the toolbar, and not when you are clicking the button in the Customize window to view its description. For example, if you click the New Message button in the main toolbar, a new composition window opens. If you hold down the Shift key and click the New Message button in the main toolbar, the Message Options dialog box appears, allowing you to select options for creating a new message (Personality and Stationery).</I></P>

<P>5.Drag the button icon to your desired position on the toolbar.</P>

<P><I>Note:If you need help at any time during toolbar customization, click the Help button in the Customize dialog box.</I></P>

<P>6.When you are finished adding toolbar buttons, click <B>Close</B> to close the Customize dialog box.</P>

<P>Following are specific instructions for the tabbed panels of the Customize window:</P>

<P><B>General</B>—The Categories list contains names of menus and submenus. The buttons correspond to commands on these menus and submenus. </P>

<P><B>Mailboxes</B>—The Mailboxes list shows the same view as your Mailboxes window, accessed by choosing Mailboxes from the Tools menu. To add a toolbar button for a mailbox, click the mailbox and drag the appropriate button to the toolbar. If the mailbox is in a closed folder, double-click the folder icon to open it and display its contents (or click the plus-sign [+] to open the folder), then click the mailbox and drag the desired button to the toolbar. Note that you cannot add a toolbar button for a mail folder. </P>

<P><B>Plugins</B>—The Plugins list shows installed message and resource <I>plugins</I>. You can add a plug-in button to the toolbar so that just by clicking the button, you launch the plug-in application. Note that if you elected to install QUALCOMM’s PureVoice voice-messaging software plug-in when you installed Eudora, Eudora automatically adds a toolbar button for the PureVoice plug-in at the extreme right of the toolbar. See<A HREF="eudo8nzd.htm"> Plugins (Extended Messaging Services)</A><U>.</U></P>

<P><B>Recipients</B>—The Recipients list on the left shows all recipients that are listed on your Quick Recipient List, which is the list of recipients to whom you frequently send mail. See <A HREF="eudo7l84.htm">Using the Quick Recipient List</A> for more information. The buttons correspond to functions you can perform when addressing and sending mail to recipients on your list: New Message To, Forward To, Redirect To (all on the Message menu), and Insert Recipient (on the Edit menu). If there are no recipients on your Quick Recipient List, the Recipients area of this dialog box panel is empty.</P>

<P><B>Stationery</B>—The Stationery list shows all of your stationery files. The buttons correspond to stationery-related commands: New Message With, Reply With, and Reply to All With, all under the Message menu. For more information on using stationery, see <A HREF="eudo2ph5.htm">Using Stationery</A>.</P>

<P><B>Personalities</B>—The Personalities list shows all of your email accounts, if you use multiple personalities (multiple accounts). The buttons correspond to personality-related commands, such as the Message menu’s Change Personality command. For more information on using multiple personalities, see <A HREF="eudo6et0.htm">Using an Alternate E-Mail Account</A>.</P>

<P><B>Moving a Toolbar Button</B></P>

<P>To change the placement of a button on the main toolbar, hold down the Alt key and drag the button to where you want it.</P>

<P><B>Removing a Toolbar Button</B></P>

<P>To remove a button from the main toolbar, hold down the Alt key and drag the button off of the toolbar.</P>

<P><B>Adding and Removing Separators</B></P>

<P>To add a separator line between two toolbar buttons where no line currently exists, first determine which button is farther from the gripper bar when the toolbar is docked. Now hold down the Alt key and carefully drag that button a little bit in the direction opposite the gripper bar. A separator line will be inserted between the two buttons. Be sure to drag the button less than one button-width away from its position; if you overdrag it, you will hop over the adjacent button and reposition the dragged button on the toolbar.</P>

<P>To remove a separator line from between two toolbar buttons, again determine which of the two buttons is farther away from the gripper bar when the toolbar is docked. Now hold down the Alt key and drag that button toward the gripper bar. The separator line is removed. Alternately, you can hold down the Alt key and drag the other button slightly in the direction away from the gripper bar, and that will remove the separator line. Again, be careful not to drag either button too far, or you will reposition it past the adjacent button on the toolbar.</P>

<P>As a safeguard against inadvertent deletions, two steps are used to delete a message from your computer: first you put the message in the Trash, then you empty the Trash. (If your incoming mail server uses IMAP, the procedure is slightly different, as described below.)</P>

<P><B>POP Procedure</B></P>

<P>To put a message in the Trash, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Select the message. </P>

<P>2. From the <B>Message</B> menu, choose <B>Delete</B>, or choose <B>Trash</B> from the <B>Transfer</B> menu, or press the <B>Delete</B> key, or click the Delete toolbar button. The message is transferred to the Trash mailbox.</P>

<P><I>Note:To cancel a deletion to the Trash, from the <B>Edit </B>menu, choose <B>Undo</B>.</I></P>

<P>To delete the messages in the Trash mailbox (removing them permanently from your computer), do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Special</B> menu, choose <B>Empty Trash</B>. Or, if the Mailboxes window is open on your desktop, right-click the Trash mailbox in the window and choose <B>Empty Trash</B> from the drop-down menu.</P>

<P>You can set up Eudora to warn you if you try to delete unread, queued, or unsent messages. To do this, use the <A HREF="eudo1m7r.htm">Extra Warnings</A> options window found in <B>Options</B> on the <B>Tools</B> menu to turn on those options.</P>

<P>Quitting Eudora empties the contents of the Trash mailbox when the <B>Empty Trash when exiting</B> option in the <A HREF="eudo8nuf.htm">Miscellaneous options window</A> found in Options on the Tools menu is turned on.</P>

<P>Finally, if you want to delete just a few messages from the Trash mailbox, open the Trash mailbox, select the desired messages, then choose <B>Delete </B>from the <B>Message</B> menu, or press the <B>Delete</B> key. Deleting a message from the Trash removes it completely.</P>

<P><B>IMAP Procedure</B></P>

<P>If you have the <B>When I delete a message, move it to Trash </B>option turned off in the Incoming Mail options window (see <A HREF="eudo8rp3.htm">Incoming Mail Options Window</A>), all new messages are delivered to your IMAP server and are kept there until you actively delete them. </P>

<P>You must perform two steps to remove a message from your computer: first mark it for deletion, then remove marked messages. </P>

<P>To mark for deletion a message stored in an IMAP mailbox or folder, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Select the message. </P>

<P>2. From the Message menu, choose <B>Delete</B>. To unmark the message for deletion, select it and then choose <B>UnDelete</B> from the Message menu. To remove all messages marked for deletion, choose <B>Purge Messages</B> from the Message menu. The messages are completely removed not only from your computer but also from the IMAP server.</P>

<P><I>Note:Once you remove marked messages using the <B>Purge Messages</B> command, these messages are gone and </I>cannot<I> be restored! Use this command with caution.</I></P>

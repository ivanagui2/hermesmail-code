<p>To be fully functional, your group must contain members in addition to yourself. Once you invite someone, you can determine at what level a role they will play within the share group. You can invite members to the group who can receive only the group messages. </p>

<p>To invite users to join your group, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools </b>menu, choose <b>ESP</b> <b>Groups</b>. The ESP Groups window appears.</p>

<p>2.In the left column, choose the Group name to which you want to invite members. </p>

<p>3.Click the <b>User</b> tab. The User dialog box appears.</p>

<p>4.Click <b>Invite</b>. The Share Group Role Settings dialog box appears.</p>

<p>To add a user to receive the group messages only, press the Shift key while clicking<b> Invite</b>. The Advanced Add dialog box appears where you can enter the person’s name and email address. The user’s name and email address is stored in your Users list, but ESP doesn’t send an invitation. This user receives only email messages that have the group shared documents as attachments. </p>

<p>5.You can determine which tasks each invitee to your group can do. In the <i>Initial Role</i> area, choose of the following roles:</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font><b>No Preference</b></p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font><b>Full Membership</b> (user sends and receives updates). This allows the person you invite to receive from and send files to the group, either automatically or manually.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font><b>Broadcasting Member </b>(user only sends updates, ignores any incoming updates). This allows the person you invite to send files top the group only, either automatically or manually. Incoming files are ignored.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font><b>Receiving Member</b> (user never sends updates, but processes incoming updates). This allows the person you invite to receive files from the group only. Any changes you make to the shared folder are ignored.</p>

<p>The system default is <b>No Preference</b>.</p>

<p>6.In the <i>Notifications</i> area, do the following:</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If you want ESP to notify the person you invite when updates are coming into your shared folder, check the <b>Ask before processing any updates INCOMING TO my shared folder</b> box. This box is checked by default. </p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If you want ESP to notify the person you invite when updates are going out of your shared folder, check the <b>Ask before processing any updates OUTGOING FROM my shared folder</b> box. This box is checked by default.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If you want ESP to warn you when the potential member attempts to change role type, check the <b>Prefer that user does not change role (displays warning)</b> box. If checked, the member can change role type but is discouraged to do so.  </p>

<p>7.Click <b>OK</b>. A message window opens that contains an invitation message for the selected group. This message has a special attachment containing the group invitation. </p>

<p>8.In an open message window, enter the email addresses of the invitee(s) in the <i>To:</i> header.</p>

<p>When an invitee accepts the invitation, information contained in the attachment creates a group entry in the invitee’s Groups window and prompts him or her to specify a group folder and mailbox. ESP sends an RSVP message back to the inviter. The inviter then sends an updated copy of the membership list to all the members.</p>

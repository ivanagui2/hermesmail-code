<P>These options control some of Eudora’s advanced network functions.</P>

<P><I><B>Note:</B> Consult your email administrator before modifying any of these options.</I></P>

<P>To display the Advanced Network options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Advanced Network</B>. The Advanced Network options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Advanced Network:</P>

<P><B>Network open timeout _ seconds</B> [default: 60] —— This option lets you set the number of seconds before an attempt to make a network connection will time out. For some servers (especially those with heavy loads), the attempt to establish the network connection can take longer than it takes to send data back and forth once the connection has been made. A familiar example: When you are browsing the World Wide Web, you may find that it takes a while to connect to a server, but then, once you have connected to the server, the Web page can seem to download very quickly. This option therefore gives you the ability to set a different (and usually longer) timeout for establishing the network connection than the timeout after the connection has been made (the latter timeout is set via the Network timeout after _ seconds option, below).</P>

<P><B>Network timeout after _ seconds</B> [default: 60] —— This option lets you set the number of seconds before an established network connection will time out. See the discussion above for the Network open timeout _ seconds option.</P>

<P><B>Network buffer size of _ bytes</B> [default: 4096] —— This option lets you set the size, in bytes, of the buffer that Eudora uses to transfer information to and from the server.</P>

<P><I>Note:If you are having trouble transferring large messages, the size of this buffer may be decreased.</I></P>

<P><B>Cache network info</B> —— This option causes Eudora to remember the results of previous database functions when using the Winsock connection method. This speeds up database functions within a single Eudora session.</P>

<P><B>Unload Winsock DLL after closing socket —</B>— If you are using the Trumpet Winsock stack for dialup, select this option  if you like to have your computer dial and hang-up between functions, for example sending and receiving mail. </P>

<p>The Mailboxes window lets you create new mailboxes and folders, remove and rename them, and move mailboxes among folders. Mailboxes or folders that are bolded have unread messages.</p>

<p>By default, the Mailboxes window is provided as the first window in a five-window tool group docked vertically to the left side of the main Eudora window.</p>

<p>To open a mailbox or folder within the window, double-click it, or click it once and press Enter. You can move among the folders and mailboxes using the up and down arrow keys, or close or open folders using the left and right arrow keys. You can also start typing the name of the mailbox or folder you want, and it is highlighted when you have typed enough unique characters to identify it (the item must be displayed, so a mailbox that is in a closed folder cannot be selected).</p>

<p>Right-click any item in the Mailboxes window and a pop-up menu appears whose commands let you, depending on the item, create, remove, and rename mailboxes and folders, open existing mailboxes and folders, and empty the trash from the Trash mailbox.</p>

<p><i>Note: Try not to keep too many messages in your In, Out, or Trash mailboxes because it can slow down your system’s performance. However, you can transfer messages from your In and Out boxes to other mailboxes and delete messages from you Trash box on a regular basis.</i></p>

<p>The folder trees displayed in the Mailboxes window, and some of the operations available from the pop-up menu, depend on whether your incoming mail server for one or more mail accounts uses the POP or the IMAP protocol. </p>

<p>To create a new mailbox or folder in the Mailboxes window, do the following:</p>

<p>1. Right-click on the folder. A pop-up menu appears.</p>

<p>2. From the pop-up menu, choose <b>New</b>. A dialog box appears requesting the name of the new mailbox or folder.</p>

<p>3. Type in the new name, check the <b>Make it a folder</b> option if you want to, and click <b>OK</b>. If you chose to make it a folder, enter the name of the mailbox when the dialog box appears again, and click <b>OK</b>. The new mailbox or folder appears in the lists, and is added to the Mailbox and Transfer menus.</p>

<p>To rename a mailbox or folder, do the following:</p>

<p>1. Click the mailbox or folder name once, pause, then click again to highlight just the name. </p>

<p>2. Type in the new name. Or, right-click the item and choose <b>Rename</b>, or click once on the item and press <b>F2</b>, then type in the new name. </p>

<p>3. Press <b>Enter</b> to accept your change, or <b>Esc</b> to cancel it.</p>

<p>To move a mailbox from one folder to another, in the Mailboxes window select the one you want to move and drag it to where you want it.</p>

<p>To remove a mailbox or folder, either right-click it and choose <b>Delete</b> from the pop-up menu, or click once on it to highlight it and then press the Delete key.</p>

<p>If you choose to remove a mailbox in which messages are still stored, or a folder in which other mailboxes or folders are stored, you are prompted to confirm the deletion for each such item selected. Click <b>Remove it </b>to delete the current item for which you are being prompted, or click <b>Remove all</b> to remove all items selected for deletion—no further prompts will appear. Or click <b>Cancel</b> to cancel the deletion. If you delete a non-empty mailbox or folder, all messages, mailboxes, and folders contained within the mailbox or folder are also deleted.</p>

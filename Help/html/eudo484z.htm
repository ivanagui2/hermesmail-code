<P>To close a tabbed window, click the "x" close button in the corner of the window.</P>

<P>Alternately, right-click any tab in the window, or on the window border, and choose <B>Hide</B> from the context menu (right-click).</P>

<P>Note that when you close or hide a tabbed window, the contents of all member windows, and the state and position of the tabbed window, are all preserved. When you redisplay the tabbed window, the active window shows its prior contents and the tabbed window appears in its prior state and position.</P>

<P>However, if you attempt to close or hide a tabbed window in which the active window contains unsaved changes, or you attempt to deactivate that active window by making another window active in the group, Eudora asks you if you want to save your changes. </P>

<H2><A NAME="sorting_messages_in_mailboxes"></A>Sorting Messages in Mailboxes</H2>

<P>When you check your mail and new messages come into your In box or are filtered into other mailboxes, the new messages are placed in their mailboxes in the order in which they arrive. By default, these new messages appear at the bottom of the message summary list in the mailbox window. Note that this is not necessarily a strict date order, since occasionally messages may arrive out of date order. (The date indicates when the message was sent, not when you receive them.)</P>

<P>Similarly, when you transfer messages to another mailbox, those messages appear at the bottom of the message summary list in that mailbox.</P>

<P>You can sort messages in a mailbox by status, priority, attachment, label, sender, date, size, server status, subject, and group by subject. You can sort these messages in either ascending or descending order one column at a time or by combining several columns in the sort.</P>

<P><B>Simple Sorting</B></P>

<P>You can access Eudora’s sort feature to perform a simple sort in three ways:</P>

<P>By clicking the column header you want to sort. For example, if you click the Who column, senders of your messages are sorted in alphabetically order. </P>

<P>By right-clicking anywhere on the column headings. The context menu (right-click) appears for you to choose a sort criteria for that column. For example, if you choose the item to sort in descending order, the mailbox sorts from top to bottom. </P>

<P>By choosing the Sort from the Edit menu. The Sort submenu appears for you to choose a column heading to sort.</P>

<P>The normal sort order is ascending, for example, with the most current dates at the bottom of the list. If you hold down the Shift key and click the column header, the sorting becomes descending. You can mix ascending and descending sorts when sorting more than one column at a time.</P>

<P>In each column heading, you can choose if that heading has no sort, is sorted in ascending order, or sorted in descending order. Also, you can group subjects together by choosing <B>Group by Subject</B>, which keeps messages with the same subject together all the time.</P>

<P>Messages (including replies) with the same subject, such as a work project are kept together in the mailbox regardless of whether you sort by Date, Sender, and so on. A checkmark next to the Group by Subject option in the context menu (right-click) indicates that the option is active.</P>

<P>New messages that come into a sorted mailbox will automatically be placed in the correct sorted order. For example, if you have a mailbox sorted by date, and you want all of the messages to be grouped by subject, any new messages will be grouped with other messages containing the same subject in a chronological. </P>

<P>You can also sort message in the Find Messages window when the Results panel is active. </P>

<P><B>Complex sorting</B></P>

<P>You can perform complex sorting by holding down the Ctrl key and click one column, then another column, and so on. The columns are sorted in the order you clicked on them. For example, if you click the Subject column first and then the Date column, the subjects in this mailbox sort alphabetically and then chronologically. You will notice numbers in each column header indicating the order of the sort. </P>

<P>To perform a complex sort, you can click two columns or all eight! To cancel the sort, just click on the column that displays 1. All the sort criteria will cancel.</P>

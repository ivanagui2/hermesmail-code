<P>To go offline, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Move your mouse pointer to the taskbar and right-click. A context drop-down menu appears.</P>

<P>2.From the context menu (right-click), choose <B>Offline</B>. You are now disconnected from your IMAP server.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Disable timed mail checks</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Manually check for mail</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Transfer and delete messages after they are retrieved. However, a dialog box appears asking you to connect for as long as it takes to transfer and delete your messages. When the tasks are completed, you immediately disconnect from the server. </P>

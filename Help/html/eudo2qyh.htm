<P>In Eudora, you can link a signature and a stationery to an existing personality via the Account Settings dialog box. For example, if you have a "Business" personality, you can link your "Business" signature and "Business" stationery to this personality. For creating signatures and stationery, refer to <A HREF="eudo9k6d.htm">Creating a Signature</A> and <A HREF="eudo70md.htm">Creating a Stationery File</A>. Before you can link a signature and stationery to a personality, you need to create them first. </P>

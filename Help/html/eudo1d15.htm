<P>In the lower left corner of the message summary part of each mailbox window, three numbers show the size information for that mailbox. The first is the number of messages in the mailbox; the second is the total amount of space those messages require; the third is the amount of disk space that is wasted with the mailbox.</P>

<P>Wasted space is created when messages are deleted from a mailbox. This wasted space is automatically removed when the amount of wasted space in the mailbox is greater than the amount of space the messages in the mailbox use, or if the amount of space wasted in the mailbox is greater than 5% of the free space on the disk drive that contains it.</P>

<P>To manually clean up the wasted space in a mailbox, click the mailbox’s size display. Or, to clean up all your mailboxes, choose <B>Compact Mailboxes </B>from the <B>Special</B> menu.</P>

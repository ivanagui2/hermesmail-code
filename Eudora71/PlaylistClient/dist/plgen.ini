; plgen.ini -- specify default values for playlists generated with plgen.exe.
;
; Notes:
;	Sections are currently ignored, which works because all the key names are
;   currently unique. At some point they'll probably be required.
;
;	No leading/trailing spaces please. Values (right side of '=') do get
;	cleaned up as a service to the sloppy, but in general spaces will cause
;	settings to be ignored.
;
;	Tags are generated for all playlist elements, even if a default value is not
;	provided in this file---they are simply empty. This allows one to open the
;	playlist file in XML Spy, or other editor, and just "fill in the blanks".
;
;	Have fun!

<H2><A NAME="using_the_composition_window"></A>Use the Composition Window</H2>

<P>The composition window consists of the title bar, the Toolbar, the message header, and the message body.</P>

<P><B>Title Bar</B></P>

<P>The title bar provides information about the message, including the name of the addressee, the time and date the message was sent, and the message subject.</P>

<P><B>Toolbar</B></P>

<P>The toolbar consists of a series of buttons and drop-downs that are displayed just under the title bar. It allows you to control the priority of your message, override some of your default options for the current message, send or queue the message, and apply text styles. Each button can be turned on or off for the current message by clicking it (a button is on when it is depressed, and off when it is raised). You can set some of the defaults for the toolbar in the<A HREF="eudo4mnr.htm"> Composing Mail Options Window</A>.</P>

<P>The drop-down menus and buttons on the top row are described below.</P>

<P><B>Priority Popup —</B><B>—</B> This lets you indicate that your message is of higher or lower priority than a normal message. For most messages, this is just an empty box (normal priority). For details, see <A HREF="eudo1hx5.htm">Setting the Message Priority</A> .</P>

<P><B>Signature Popup —</B><B>—</B> This lets you automatically append one of your signatures to the end of a message. For details, see <A HREF="eudo5ahx.htm">Using a Signature</A> .</P>

<P><B>Attachment Type Popup —</B><B>—</B> This lets you select the encoding format for attachments. For details, see <A HREF="eudo96sl.htm">Attaching a File to a Message</A> .</P>

<P><B>Quoted-Printable Encoding —</B><B>—</B> If this is on, quoted-printable encoding is used when sending messages that contain special characters or long lines of text. It is used for all plain-text attachments. We recommend that you always keep this on.</P>

<P><B>Text As Attachment —</B><B>—</B> If this is on, plain text files are attached to messages, not incorporated into the message as part of the message body.</P>

<P><B>Word Wrap —</B><B>—</B> If this is on, a carriage return is not required at the end of each line. When the message is sent, the text is automatically "wrapped," meaning that carriage returns are inserted at the end of each line of text, with roughly 76 characters per line.</P>

<P><B>Tabs in Body —</B><B>—</B> If this button is on, pressing the Tab key within the message body inserts a tab. If this button is off, pressing the Tab key within the message body returns the cursor to the <B>To</B> field of the message header.</P>

<P><B>Keep Copy —</B><B>—</B> If this is on, a copy of each sent message is kept in the Out mailbox. These messages are saved there until they are deleted or transferred.</P>

<P><B>Return Receipt —</B><B>—</B> (Sponsored and Paid modes only) If this is on, the message to your recipients includes a <B>Notify Sender</B> button that when clicked creates a message notifying you that the original message has been viewed. This function does not work in all cases. For details, see <A HREF="eudo30j8.htm">Requesting a Return Receipt</A> .</P>

<P><B>Show Text Symbols —</B>— If this is on, invisible text symbols, such as carriage returns, tabs, and spaces appear in the message. You can see these symbols only in your composition window. They do not appear in the message you send.</P>

<P><B>Send or Queue —</B><B>—</B> These choices let you send a message immediately or put it in the queue to send later. If the Immediate Send option in the <A HREF="eudo1fp3.htm">Sending Mail Options Window</A> is on, the button is labeled Send. If the option is off, the button is labeled Queue. For details, see <A HREF="eudo10mx.htm">Sending a Message Immediately</A> or <A HREF="eudo3j1u.htm">Queueing a Message to Send Later</A>.</P>

<P>Following are descriptions of the drop-down menus and buttons on the bottom row. Note that this bottom row of the toolbar, which controls text styles and other attributes, also appears in text file and signature windows.</P>

If you change the text color, then this button will retain and display that color.  When you want to change colors, click this button and choose the color from the drop-down menu. Note that if you change the text color to Automatic, this button will not change color. You can also ignore the color change by pressing the Shift key while changing colors.</P>

<P><B>Message Header—</B>—Outgoing mail headers consist of six fields: <B>To</B>, <B>From</B>, <B>Subject</B>, <B>Cc</B>, <B>Bcc</B>, and <B>Attached</B>. Each field is described below. The To, Subject, Cc, and Bcc fields can be directly edited. To move the cursor from field to field, press the Tab key or click in the desired field with the mouse.</P>

<P>To resize the Header region of the outgoing message window, drag the separator up or down. This applies to the current message only.</P>

<P><B>To: </B>The intended recipients’ email addresses or nicknames you have defined (see <A HREF="eudo9mi3.htm">Using the Address Book</A> and <A HREF="eudo7l84.htm">Using the Quick Recipient List</A>). Multiple addresses and nicknames must be separated by commas. If you have the Automatic Name Completion turned on (see <A HREF="eudo5lx3.htm">Auto-Completion Options Window</A>), a window appears with your address book and history files entries for you to select.</P>

<P><B>From: </B>The sender’s email address. This is usually your incoming email account plus your real name. You can use a return address other than your incoming mail account by entering the address in the <B>Return address</B> field of the <A HREF="eudo93nb.htm">Getting Started Options Window</A>. If you have more than one personality, click From to display your personality list and choose the personality you want to use.</P>

<P>The From field also reflects changes made with the <B>Change Personality</B> menu under the Message menu, if you have alternate personalities set up. See <A HREF="eudo6et0.htm">Using an Alternate E-mail Account</A> .</P>

<P><B>Subject: </B>Some brief text indicating the contents of the message. This field can be left blank although it is considered a point of email etiquette to include a Subject with each message.</P>

<P><B>Cc: </B>The email addresses or nicknames of people to whom a copy of the message is to be sent. These recipients are displayed in the message header for all recipients to see. Multiple addresses must be separated by commas. This field can be left blank. Cc stands for "carbon copy."  If you have the Automatic Name Completion turned on (see <A HREF="eudo5lx3.htm">Auto-Completion Options Window</A>), a window appears with your address book and history files entries for you to select.</P>

<P><B>Bcc: </B>The email addresses or nicknames of people to whom a blind copy of the message is to be sent. These recipients are not displayed in the message header, and the recipients in the <B>To</B> or <B>Cc</B> fields will not know that a copy went to these addresses. Multiple addresses must be separated by commas. This field can be left blank. Bcc stands for "blind carbon copy."  If you have the Automatic Name Completion turned on (see <A HREF="eudo5lx3.htm">Auto-Completion Options Window</A>), a window appears with your address book and history files entries for you to select.</P>

<P>This field also can be used to put a copy of the message in one or more of your mailboxes. To do this, right-click in the body of the message and select the mailbox from the <B>Fcc</B> menu (equivalent to the Transfer menu). The name of the mailbox is inserted into the <B>Bcc</B> field preceded by the expression "I\." Repeat the procedure to Fcc to multiple mailboxes; Eudora automatically separates the entries with commas. When the message is sent, a copy is put in each specified mailbox. Fcc stands for "folder carbon copy."</P>

<P><B>Attached:</B> A list of documents being attached to and sent along with the message. See <A HREF="eudo96sl.htm">Attaching a File to a Message</A> for instructions on how to add attachments. To delete an attachment from an outgoing message, select it and press the backspace or delete key. This field can be left blank.</P>

<P><B>Message Body —</B>—<B> </B>After filling in the header fields, move the insertion point to the space below the message header. Type the body of the message here. For information about formatting your message text, see <A HREF="eudo7tkk.htm">Formatting Text</A>.</P>

<P>You can insert pictures and horizontal lines into message text. For details, see <A HREF="eudo63g4.htm">Inserting Objects in Message Text</A>.</P>

<P>The Internet Service Provider (ISP) with whom you have your primary email account may not allow you to send messages through any other Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server but their own. If you have accounts at other ISPs or third-party email services, you may not be able to send mail from those accounts unless you use your primary ISP's SMTP servers. The SMTP relay feature allows you to send all your mail through your primary ISP's server. </P>

<P>To use SMTP relay:</P>

<P>1.From the Tools menu, choose <B>Options</B>. </P>

<P>2.Scroll and click <B>Sending Mail</B>.  The Sending Mail dialog appears.</P>

<P>3.In the <I>SMTP Relay Personality</I> field, choose the personality previously set up for the SMTP relay from the drop-down menu. None is the default. </P>

<P>4.Click OK. </P>

<P>All messages sent from each of your personalities will use the account information for the selected personality. </P>

<P>For example, if you bring your computer to a friend's house or your office, you can easily change your SMTP relay to a personality that uses a different ISP to send mail. Or, you can set the relay personality to None so that you can send all mail directly to the servers for each personality.</P>

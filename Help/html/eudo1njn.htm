<P>From time to time, everyone comes up with an idea for something they'd like their software to do differently. This is true of all applications, no less Eudora. If you come across an idea that you think might make a nice enhancement to Eudora, your input is always welcome. To send any suggestions or requests for new features, go to <U>http://www.eudora.com/developers/feedback</U></P>

<P>You will receive an automated response indicating that your suggestion has been received and forwarded to our engineering staff. Unless additional information is needed, you will not receive a direct response.</P>

<P>To change the password for one of your personalities, choose <B>Change Password</B> from the <B>Special</B> menu, and select the personality whose password you want to change. You are prompted to enter your old password once and your new password twice. Depending on the server you are using, the password can be up to 30 characters, but normally it is only 7 or 8.</P>

<P><I>Note:This only works if the incoming mail server is running a compatible password-change server. For information about these servers, see the "Sources" section of the Online Eudora User Manual.</I></P>

<P>When you choose a new password, try not to use real words, names, dates, or familiar acronyms. Some systems require you to use at least one number or symbol in your password, and you may want to do that even if it is not required.</P>

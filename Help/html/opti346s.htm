<P>Turn this on when you need to have the MAPI client send a single TXT or HTML file as an attachment with no message body text. Eudora turns off the Text As Attachment button in the outgoing message toolbar (if it is on), so that the document is sent to the recipient as inline text in the message body. This allows MAPI clients, such as Internet Explorer, to pass Web pages and other HTML and TXT documents right into the body of the Eudora message. (The Text As Attachment button, if turned on in the outgoing message toolbar, instructs Eudora to attach text files, such as TXT and HTML, to the message rather than incorporating the text into the message as part of the message body. The default state of this button is controlled by the Put text attachments in body of message option in the Attachments options. </P>

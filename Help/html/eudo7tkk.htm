<P>You can use standard text-editing options to format the text of your outgoing messages, your text files, and your signatures. The formatting your recipient sees depends on how well their email package supports these standards.</P>

<P>It’s important to remember that you cannot completely control what happens on your recipient’s computer. Depending on the type of computer they are using, their installed fonts, and their options or preferences, they could end up viewing something different from what you had intended. Although your formatting changes are sent to your recipient, your default text settings are not. Any text that you did not change appears using your recipient’s default text, which may be different from yours.</P>

<P>Text in outgoing messages, text files, and signature files can be formatted using the commands on the Edit menu <B>Text</B> submenu and using the formatting toolbar.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>To format text, use the text styles buttons on the message window’s Icon bar or from the <B>Text</B> submenu from the <B>Edit</B> menu. You can change the font, size, style, color, and the margins.</P>

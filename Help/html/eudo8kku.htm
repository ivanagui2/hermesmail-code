<P>During a mail check, your incoming messages are normally transferred from your account on the POP server to your computer, and then deleted from the POP server. But this can be awkward if you want to read mail from two or more computers and keep your mail organized at the same time.</P>

<P>There are several options that you can use to control your mail transfers and the storage on the server. Some of these options are available in the <A HREF="eudo8rp3.htm">Incoming Mail Options Window</A> for your dominant account only, and the <B>Account Settings</B> window, for any of your personalities; some of the options are available in the <B>Mail Transfer</B> options window. To access these windows, open the <B>Tools</B> menu and choose <B>Options</B>. Scroll to find the windows you need.</P>

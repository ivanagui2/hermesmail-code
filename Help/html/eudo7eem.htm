<P>If for some reason an email message can’t be delivered to a recipient, mail transport agents return the message to the original sender (you). A message is typically rejected because of an error in the recipient’s address, although other reasons are possible.</P>

<P>The return message usually includes cryptic information that may let you determine the reason the message was rejected. It also includes the text of the original message.</P>

<P>You can easily recover the original message, make any corrections, and resend it.  To resend a rejected message again, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Message</B> menu, choose <B>Send Again</B>. This eliminates the inserted extra text and reformats the message as it originally appeared. You can then make changes or additions and send the message again.</P>

<P>The <B>Send Again</B> command is also useful for resending saved messages—from your Out box, for example—and messages you’ve copied to yourself, in order to save yourself some retyping. You can send the same message to another recipient to avoid having to retype the whole message, or you can send a different message to the same recipients to avoid having to retype their addresses in the header.</P>

<P>Another way to send a message again: </P>

<P>1. In a mailbox window, open or select the desired message. </P>

<P>2. From the Tools menu, choose Personalities, or select the Personalities tab. The Personalities window opens.</P>

<P>3. Right-click a personality, and from the <B>Message</B> submenu of the drop-down menu, choose <B>Send Again As</B>. </P>

<P>The message is sent again but from the selected personality (which may or may not be the same as the personality under which it was originally sent).</P>

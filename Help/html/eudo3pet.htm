<H2><A NAME="skipping_attachments_over_a_certain_size"></A>Full Message Except Attachments Over _ K</H2>

<P>To prevent Eudora from transferring large attachments to your computer during mail checks, turn on the <B>Full message except attachments over _ K</B> option and specify a size. You can set this option in the Incoming Mail options for your main account, or in the Account Settings dialog box for any of your personalities. See <A HREF="eudo8rp3.htm">Incoming Mail Options Window</A>.</P>

<P>Subsequently, each time mail is checked for the account, attachments larger than the specified size are not transferred to your computer with the message. The rest of the message is transferred including the complete message body. Attachments within the specified size are also transferred.</P>

<P>Attachments not transferred during mail checks can be retrieved, however. When you open or preview the message associated with the attachment, an icon for the attachment appears in the incoming message window or the message preview pane. To retrieve the attachment, do the following:</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Click the icon to retrieve the attachment from the IMAP server or right-click a message to display the drop-down menu; and from the drop-down menu, choose <B>Fetch</B>, then <B>Include Attachments</B>.</P>

<P>If you wish to re-retrieve a message at any time, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Right-click a message to display the drop-down menu. </P>

<P>2.From the drop-down menu, choose <B>Fetch</B>. </P>

<P>3.Either choose <B>Include Attachments</B> or <B>Use Defaults</B>. If you want to delete the local copy of a message, right-click the message to display the drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, choose <B>Remove Cached Contents</B>. The message still exists on the server if you want to re-retrieve it. </P>

<P>If the "Full message except attachments over _ K" option is deselected, then all attachments are transferred to your computer during mail checks, regardless of their size.</P>

<P><I><B>Important:</B> In IMAP, your attachments download to the Attach folder, which is in the IMAP folder. However, if you have previously set up a directory in the Attachments options window where you want your attachments to go, all attachments (POP and IMAP) go to that directory. See <A HREF="eudo0ref.htm">Attachments Options Window</A>.</I></P>

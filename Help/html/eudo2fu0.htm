<P>When you open a new composition window to begin writing a new message, MoodWatch scans each word and phrase you type and determines if it might be offensive to your recipient. The level of offensiveness is indicated by the appearance of one, two, or three red chili peppers, with three red chilies being the most offensive and one the least. As you write, chili peppers appear next to the Send or Queue button.</P>

<P>Less offensive phrases are underlined with a green squiggly line and more offensive phrases are underlined in both a red and green squiggly line. </P>

<P>After you click <B>Send</B> or <B>Queue</B>, a warning appears indicating there is offensive text in your email message. </P>

<P>To send the message despite the offensive text, click <B>Send Anyway</B>. Your message is sent. If you have Eudora set to Queue messages for later transmission, you can still retrieve the message in the Out mailbox to edit or delete it. You can then send the message or requeue it. </P>

<P>To return to the composition window without sending or queueing the message, click <B>Cancel</B>.</P>

<P>By changing the options in the MoodWatch settings dialog, you can have MoodWatch scan your incoming messages for offensive text as well. The indicators are one, two, or three chili peppers appearing in the mailbox message summary column.</P>

<P>Also, by turning on an option in the MoodWatch options, you can have MoodWatch scan and display chili peppers on all of your stored mail. </P>

<P>See MoodWatch Options Window. </P>

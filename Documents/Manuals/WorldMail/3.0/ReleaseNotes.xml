	<section title="Installation">
		<html>
			This program will install all the necessary components to run MailSite as an email server or a gateway. 
			This program will automatically detect the installation method:<p />
			
			<ul>
				<li>Major upgrade installation</li>
				<li>Minor upgrade installation</li>
				<li>New installation</li>
			</ul>
	
			<b>MAJOR UPGRADE INSTALLATION</b><p />
	
			A major upgrade is an upgrade from versions 4.x or 5.x. The upgrade installation process keeps all the previous
			settings and does not make any modifications. It will, however, add a new Windows account called MSIISUSER and will
			add some non-intrusive permissions to this account for the use of MailSite Express running under the IIS web service.
			This new Windows account is a standard user we have adopted which will be needed in future MailSite upgrade
			installations. The only problem that may occur is that propagation of this new user rights can take a long time if
			the message store is large.<p />
	
			The upgrade installation process does take into consideration previous MailSite Clustered installations. All
			permissions, settings and configuration settings will be left intact.<p />
	
			<b>MINOR UPGRADE INSTALLATION</b><p />
	
			A minor upgrade is an upgrade from a previous 6.x version. The upgrade process simply updates the files for features
			that are already installed. All permissions, settings and configuration settings will be left intact.<p />
	
			<b>NEW INSTALLATION</b><p />
	
			The new installation assumes that any previous version of MailSite has been removed or the operating system has been
			newly installed. The installation will configure MailSite with the necessary accounts and permissions for the
			MailSite directory and subdirectories.<p /> 
	
			For additional installation documentation please check:<br />
			<a href="http://www.rockliffe.com/support/docs">http://www.rockliffe.com/support/docs</a><p />
	
			<b>CLUSTERED INSTALLATIONS</b><p /> 
	
			New clustered installations require additional configuration.  When clustering MailSite please keep the following
			information in mind:<p /> 
			
			<ul>
				<li>SQL server is required</li>
				<li>At least 2 servers are needed for a clustered environment</li>
				<li>A Specific MailSite user needs to be pre-configured with access to the:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>BOX directory location</li>
					<li>The MailSite directory location</li>
					<li>The MailSite Express directory location</li>
					<li>Access to IIS for use with MailSite Express</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

	<section title="Security Configurations">
		<html>
			The installer will set sufficient user and folder permissions for MailSite and all of its components to run in a
			single server configuration. The following default permissions are assigned by the installer:<p /> 
	
			<b>Table 1 - MailSite Security Settings</b><br />
			<table class="grid" width="500" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="grid">
						<b>Folder</b>
					</td>
					<td class="grid">
						<b>User/Group</b>
					</td>
					<td class="grid">
						<b>Permission</b>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="grid">\MailSite</td>
					<td class="grid">SYSTEM</td>
					<td class="grid">Modify</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="grid">\MailSite</td>
					<td class="grid">MSIISUSER</td>

					<td class="grid">\MailSite\Express\Web\Cache</td>
					<td class="grid">[IIS Process Identity]</td>
					<td class="grid">Modify</td>
				</tr>
			</table><p />
			
			By default, these permissions are set explicitly on each of the listed folders and will be inherited by all files
			and folders under the C:\program files\MailSite directory or the location you specify as the installation location.<p /> 
	
			Please keep these permission settings in consideration when making modifications to your installation.<p />

		<section title="Known Issues">
		<html>
			Within this Release of MailSite there are these known issue within the product that will be resolved in a future release :-<p></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The SMTPRA Service has a possible small Memory Leak on some installations which is currently under investigation.  Inititial results have shown it is likely to be Anti Virus related and only after a prolonged period of heavy use.  Rockliffe recommend monitoring the Virtual Memory usage of SMTPRA and restarting the service if it exceeds 1GB.</li>
				<li>When using an E-mail Client and connecting via IMAP you see the correct count of messages when you log into your account but then a number of messages will disappear from the folder.  This is only a temporary issue, there is no data loss,  restarting your E-mail client will resolve this issue. It is very intermittent and will not affect all users.</li>

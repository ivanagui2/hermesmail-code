<P>To include a particular signature in <I>all</I> of your outgoing messages—unless you are using stationery—select a signature from the Signature drop-down list in the (for your dominant account only), or in the Account Settings dialog (for any of your personalities). You can change this signature for a particular message by selecting a different signature or <B>None</B> from the Signature drop-down on the message toolbar.</P>

<P>Note that if you open a new composition message with stationery or if you have default stationery set for all new messages, then the signature stored with that stationery file is the one used with the new message, overriding any default signature. However, you can always make the final decision about what signature to send with a new message by choosing it from the Signature drop-down listM on the message toolbar.

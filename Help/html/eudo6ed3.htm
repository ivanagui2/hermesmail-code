<P>The Mailboxes window lets you create new mailboxes and folders, remove and rename them, and move mailboxes among folders. Mailboxes or folders that are bolded have unread messages.</P>

<P>By default, the Mailboxes window is provided as the first window in a five-window tool group docked vertically to the left side of the main Eudora window.</P>

<P>To open the Mailboxes window, choose <B>Mailboxes </B>from the <B>Tools</B> menu, or click the Mailboxes window tab if it is part of a visible tabbed window group. See <A HREF="eudo1pv7.htm">Window States and Tabbed Windows</A> .</P>

<P>To open a mailbox or folder within the window, double-click it, or click it once and press <B>Enter</B>. You can move among the folders and mailboxes using the up and down arrow keys, or close or open folders using the left and right arrow keys. You can also start typing the name of the mailbox or folder you want, and it is highlighted when you have typed enough unique characters to identify it (the item must be displayed, so a mailbox that is in a closed folder cannot be selected).</P>

<P>Right-click any item in the Mailboxes window and a drop-down menu appears whose commands let you, depending on the item, create, remove, and rename mailboxes and folders, open existing mailboxes and folders, empty the trash from the Trash mailbox, and find messages in mailboxes and folders.</P>

<P>The folder trees displayed in the Mailboxes window, and some of the operations available from the drop-down menu, depend on whether your incoming mail server for one or more mail accounts uses the POP or the IMAP protocol. For more information on these differences, see <A HREF="eudo4xma.htm">Mailbox and Folder Management: POP vs. IMAP Server</A> .</P>

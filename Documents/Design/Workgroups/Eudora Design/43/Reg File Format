Description: Eudora registration file information

The format of the Eudora registration file is a text file containing 
RFC 822 header fields. Currently, all defined fields are 
unstructured; that is, they may be folded, but there are no comments, 
quoted-strings, or other parsing requirements for these fields. The 
fields bodies should be considered without regard to case; 
comparisons between field bodies should be done case-insensitively.

The first line of the file is always a field whose field name is 
"Eudora-File-Type". Subsequent lines are fields that appear in the 
profile for the particular file type and are defined below. Fields 
which do not appear in the profile for the file type should be 
ignored unless otherwise noted below.

The MIME type for these files is "application/vnd.eudora.data". Even 
though it appears in the application top-level type, regular text 
canonicalization rules apply to this file.

The Macintosh file creator for this file is (as usual) 'CSOm'. The 
file type is 'eReg'.

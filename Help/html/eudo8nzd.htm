<P>Plug-ins are special add-ons that can be installed to add features to Eudora. For example, you could use a language conversion plug-in to translate a message to another language, a security plug-in to automatically secure a message, or a text manipulation plug-in to change lowercase to uppercase. Plug-ins interface to Eudora using the Extended Messaging Services Application Programming Interface (EMSAPI). </P>

<P>•To make <I>plugins</I> available to Eudora, put them in the <B>Plugins</B> directory in your Eudora Email directory, then restart Eudora. Depending on the plug-in type, it will be available in Eudora through the following methods:</P>

<P>-The <B>Message Plugins</B> submenu (in the <B>Edit</B> menu) typically includes <I>plugins</I> that are used to modify the text of a message. These are referred to as on-request <I>plugins</I>. Some samples of these types of <I>plugins</I> are available with Eudora: Sort, UpperLower, and Unwrap.</P>

<P>-Icons in the message window are typically for <I>plugins</I> that are used to manipulate messages as they are sent or when they are received. These are referred to as on-transmission and on-display <I>plugins</I>.</P>

<P>-The <B>Tools</B> menu typically includes <I>plugins</I> that are used to do tasks that are not directly related to Eudora functions. These are referred to as tools <I>plugins</I>.</P>

<P>-The <B>Attach [to New]</B> submenu (in the <B>Message</B> menu) typically includes <I>plugins</I> that are used to create and attach particular files to a message. These are referred to as attachment <I>plugins</I>.</P>

<P>-Plug-ins that are automatically used when a message is received are not available through the user interface.</P>

<P>•To see all of your currently installed <I>plugins</I>, choose <B>Message Plugins Settings</B> from the Special menu. If a plug-in has any settings options, you can use the <B>Settings</B> button to change them. </P>

<P>For information about available <I>plugins</I>, send email to &lt;eudora-rep@eudora.com&gt; or visit our web site www.eudora.com/central/plugins </P>

<h2><a name="message_summaries_in_mailboxes"></a>Message Summaries in Mailboxes</h2>

<p>Each line in the list portion of a mailbox window represents a message and is called a <i>message summary</i>. Outgoing messages that are in any mailbox other than Out are shown with <i>italicized</i> message summaries.</p>

<p>To select one or more message summaries, use one of the following options: </p>

<p>•To select one summary, click it.</p>

<p>•To select two summaries and all the summaries between them, select a summary, hold down the Shift key, and select another summary. Or, drag the mouse over the summaries to select them (as long as you begin on an unselected summary).</p>

<p>•To select all of the summaries that have the same information in a particular column, hold down the Alt key and click the column in the summary. For example, if you click the Status column for one summary, all of the summaries with that status are selected.</p>

<p>•To make nonconsecutive selections, hold down the Ctrl key and select summaries.</p>

<p>Each message summary is divided into columns: Status, Priority, Attachments, Label, Sender/Recipient (Who), Date, Size (in K), Server Status, and Subject. You can show or hide these columns using the<a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000153"> Display options window</a>.</p>

<p>A message’s Status, Priority, Label, and Server Status can be changed directly in the mailbox window. To do this, select the messages you want to change and click the right mouse button inside the selection. Select an option from the drop-down menu to make your change.</p>

<p>To turn on the display of lines in the message summaries portion of mailbox windows—horizontal lines to separate summaries, and vertical lines to separate columns—turn on the <b>Show Mailbox Lines</b> option in the Mailboxes Options Window.</p>

<p><b>Column</b></p>

<p>This column displays the message status, which is one of the following:</p>

<p>•The message has not been read (all mailboxes except Out), or is queueable or sendable but has not been queued or sent (Out mailbox only).</p>

<p>&lt;blank&gt;The message has been read (all mailboxes except Out), or is not yet able to be queued or sent because it has no recipients in the To or Bcc fields (Out mailbox only).</p>

<p>left arrowReply has been chosen for the message.</p>

<p>right arrowForward has been chosen for the message.</p>

<p>diagonal arrowRedirect has been chosen for the message.</p>

<p>check markThe message has been sent (outgoing messages only).</p>

<p>QThe message is queued to be sent (outgoing messages only).</p>

<p>clock iconThe message is queued to be sent at a specified time (outgoing messages only).</p>

<p><b>_</b>The message was transferred from the Out mailbox before being sent.</p>

<p>You can change the status of one or more selected messages, or an open message, from Read (blank) to Unread (•) or from Unread to Read by pressing <b>Shift+Space</b> (all mailboxes except Out).</p>

<p><b>Priority Column</b></p>

<p>This column displays the message priority. You can use the drop-down to set a particular priority.</p>

<p><b>Attachments Column</b></p>

<p>This column displays the attachment icon (a paper clip) if a message has attached documents.</p>

<p><b>Label Column</b></p>

<p>This column displays the message label. Labels are assigned to incoming messages by the recipient, either manually or automatically using filters (see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000120">Filtering Messages</a> ). When a message summary is assigned a label, the entire summary changes color to match the label color.</p>

<p><i>Note:Label colors and titles are assigned using the Labels options window.</i></p>

<p><b>Sender/Recipient Column (Who)</b></p>

<p>This<b> </b>column shows the sender of the message (for incoming messages) or the intended recipients (for outgoing messages).</p>

<p><i>Note:Bugs in some POP servers/mail transport systems cause HERMES to display the sender of incoming messages as ???@???. This is because the required From header is missing.</i></p>

<p><b>Date Column</b></p>

<p>This<b> </b>column displays the date and time the message was composed, or, for timed messages, the date and time the message is scheduled to be sent. Date formats, including age-sensitive indications such as the day of the week or today are set in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-0000C8">Date Display options window</a> . </p>

<p><b>Size Column (K)</b></p>

<p>This column displays the size of the message in kilobytes, K (1 K = 1,024 bytes). Also, an indicator in the Size column of mailboxes tells if the body of the message is empty.</p>

<p><b>Server Status Column (V)</b></p>

<p>This column displays the action that is done to the corresponding incoming message on the POP server. The next time you check mail, the server status you requested is automatically completed.</p>

<p>Solid diamond indicates that the message has been retrieved.</p>

<p>Open diamond indicates that the message has not yet been retrieved.</p>

<p>Half filled diamond (IMAP only) indicates that the message body is retrieved, but not all attachments.</p>

<p>An "X" indicates that the message is deleted from the server.</p>

<p>An "X" and down arrow indicate the whole message is to be retrieved and then deleted from the server.</p>

<p><i>Note:To control the mail transfer, you can also use the <b>Mail Transfer options window</b>. For details, see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-0000F4">Checking for Mail with Special Server Instructions</a>.</i></p>

<p><b>MoodWatch Column</b></p>

<p>This column displays one, two, or three red chili peppers<b> </b>indicating the level of offensive text in the message. </p>

<p><b>Subject Column</b></p>

<p>This column displays the subject of the message. The sender originally typed this information into the message header, but you can modify it (see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000127">Editing Incoming Messages</a>).</p>

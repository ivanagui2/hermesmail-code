UNWRAP.DLL
========
This DLL is a plug-in for Eudora 4.0, and must be placed in one of the
following directories to be recognized.

* The sub-directory "plugins" of the directory the Eudora.exe file is in
* The sub-directory "plugins" of your Eudora mail directory

There is only one translator contained in this plug-in, which
will only be executed when the user selects "Unwrap" from the
Message Plugins menu under the Edit menu. When executed, the
selected text will be scanned for paragraphs and all end-of-line
markers within each paragraph will be removed. This allows the
user to convert "hard-return" text into window-wrapping text.

<P>The Mailboxes window lets you create new mailboxes and folders, remove and rename them, and move mailboxes among folders. Mailboxes or folders that are bolded have unread messages.</P>

<P>By default, the Mailboxes window is provided as the first window in a five-window tool group docked vertically to the left side of the main Eudora window.</P>

<P>To open a mailbox or folder within the window, double-click it, or click it once and press <B>Enter</B>. You can move among the folders and mailboxes using the up and down arrow keys, or close or open folders using the left and right arrow keys. You can also start typing the name of the mailbox or folder you want, and it is highlighted when you have typed enough unique characters to identify it (the item must be displayed, so a mailbox that is in a closed folder cannot be selected).</P>

<P>Right-click any item in the Mailboxes window and a pop-up menu appears whose commands let you, depending on the item, create, remove, and rename mailboxes and folders, open existing mailboxes and folders, and empty the trash from the Trash mailbox.</P>

<P><I>Note: Try not to keep too many messages in your In, Out, or Trash mailboxes  because it can slow down your system’s performance. However, you can transfer messages from your In and Out boxes to other mailboxes and delete messages from you Trash box on a regular basis.</I></P>

<P>The folder trees displayed in the Mailboxes window, and some of the operations available from the pop-up menu, depend on whether your incoming mail server for one or more mail accounts uses the POP or the IMAP protocol. </P>

<P>2. Make sure there are no outgoing messages open. </P>

<P>3. Perform your query. </P>

<P>4. Select one or more summaries in your results list. </P>

<P>5. Click the <B>To</B>, <B>Cc</B>, or <B>Bcc </B>button. A new message is created, and it is addressed appropriately with the selected query results.</P>

<P>To add an address to an existing message, make sure the message you want to address is active, open the Directory Services window, perform the query, and select one or more summaries in the results list. Now click the <B>To</B>, <B>Cc</B>, or <B>Bcc</B> button. The addresses from the selected query results are added to the appropriate field of the current message.</P>

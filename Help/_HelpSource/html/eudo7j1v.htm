<h2><a name="finding_messages_in_mailboxes"></a>Finding Messages in Mailboxes</h2>

<p><i>Note. If you are using HERMES in Sponsored Light mode, you are limited to certain functions when searching for messages. </i></p>

<p>You can now perform complex searches through messages in all or a selected number of mailboxes or folders. Once your search is complete, right-click to display the context menu where  you can sort, open, view the mailbox, transfer, reply, reply to all, forward, redirect, or delete the resulting messages. You can search for a specific piece of information in all your mail or just search for a particular item that matches the criteria you set. Set up the criteria for your search by selecting options from the drop-down lists and by entering text. </p>

<p>To set up criteria for a message search, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the<b> Edit </b>menu, choose <b>Find </b>or press [Ctrl] + F. The Find submenu appears.</p>

<p>2.From the Find submenu, choose <b>Find Messages</b>. The Find Messages dialog box appears. </p>

<p>In the Find Messages dialog box, your mailboxes display along with checkboxes. If the boxes are checked, HERMES will perform a search in these mailboxes according to the criteria you are about to set up. To omit a mailbox from the search, just deselect the box. </p>

<p>If you right-click in the Find Messages window, a context menu (right-click) appears allowing you to clear all the checkmarks so you can select the mailboxes to search. Choose <b>Clear All</b> to clear the checkmarks; choose <b>Check All</b> to check all the mailboxes.</p>

<p>The top part of the dialog box is where you select and enter criteria for your search. Each search can use up to five "terms" and "conjunctions" as its criteria, connecting them as appropriate. The drop-down and conjunction lists displaying the criteria you can select. </p>

<p>3.In the drop-down criteria list (<b>Anywhere</b> is the default), choose where in the message you want HERMES to search for text. Following is a description of each option.</p>

<p>Following is a description of each conjunction option in the drop-drop list. </p>

<p><b>contains—</b>If the specific item contains the text string, search and display those messages.</p>

<p><b>contains whole word—</b>If the specific item contains the exact word, search and display those messages.</p>

<p><b>does not contain—</b>If the specific item does not contain the text string, search and display those messages.</p>

<p><b>matches x1 query—</b>(Paid mode only) If the specific items matches the x1 formatted query string, search and display those messages. This allows for complex queries to be performed within a single search criterion. </p>

<p><b>is—</b>If the specific item is an exact match, search and display those messages.</p>

<p><b>is not—</b>If the specific item is not an exact match, search and display those messages.</p>

<p><b>matches regexp (case sensitive)—</b>(only available if indexed search is turned off) If the specific item matches the regular expressions characters with case sensitivity, search and display those messages.</p>

<p>Regular Expression is a search string that uses special characters to match text characters. For example, if you are searching for messages sent to you by two people, choose <b>From</b> in the first drop-down options list, then choose <b>matches regexp</b>, then type their usernames between brackets separated by a vertical slash, e.g., <code>(bobclark)|(janedoe) </code>in the text box. HERMES searches and displays all messages from these two people. See <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-0000FD">Regular Expressions.</a> </p>

<p><i>Note. Regular Expressions is an advanced and complex method of searching for text. There are several web sites where you can get information on Regular Expressions.</i></p>

<p><b>matches regexp—</b>(only available if indexed search is turned off) If the specific item matches the regular expressions characters, search and display those messages.</p>

<p><b>is after/is before</b> (Date only)—If the date is after or before the date displayed, search and display those messages.</p>

<p><b>is greater than/is less than</b> (Age, Size, Priority, Attachment Count only)—If the specific item is greater than or less than the number indicated, search and display those messages. </p>

<p>5.Once you have chosen the conjunction, enter the text string in messages you are searching for, or choose a value from the drop down list if one displays. In the text box, you can enter as much text as you want.</p>

<p>If you click <b>Search</b>, HERMES will search through all of your mailboxes for every message that contain the text you specified anywhere in the header portion of the message.     </p>

<p>6.To continue adding a second level of criteria (you can add up to five levels), click <b>More</b>. Choose and enter more criteria to further streamline the search. You can also select <b>Match All</b> or <b>Match Any</b> to include or differentiate the criteria from one level to the other. "Match All" will find messages that match all of the criteria you entered; "Match Any" will find messages that match any of the criteria you entered.</p>

<p>If you click <b>Search</b>, HERMES will search for every message through every mailbox that contains the word you specified anywhere but only if the text you specified is somewhere in the header. </p>

<p>To continue adding a third level or criteria, click <b>More</b>. Choose and enter more criteria to further reduce the search. Click <b>Search</b> to display the messages that contain the criteria you entered.  You can now search further from the results of the search by clicking <b>More</b> to continue entering more criteria.</p>

<p>The messages that fulfill the search criteria appear in the Results window.</p>

<p>The Search feature will not work if you have any text boxes blank. You can click <b>Fewer</b> to reach a level where all text boxes are filled to conduct your search.</p>

<p>To sort the messages, click the column headings to sort by that column. To sort in descending order, click the column header again. </p>

<p>To open a message, select and double-click the message, or right-click to display the context menu (right-click). Choose <b>Open Message</b>. </p>

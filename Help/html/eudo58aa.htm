<P>If you use the POP protocol for your incoming server to retrieve mail, your mail is normally deleted from the server once it is delivered to Eudora. However, most POP incoming servers allow you to indicate that you wish to keep your mail on the server so you can retrieve it from several different computers at various times. </P>

<P>Facts you should know if you decide to leave your mail on the server:</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Some mail servers won’t allow you to keep mail on them.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Your system administrator may not allow you to keep mail on the server even though you have the option turned on. Usually administrators do not like to keep too much mail on the server because of space concerns.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Keeping a lot of mail on the server may slow down the mail checking process.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>If you check mail from several computers at different times, you can end up reading your messages two or more times. However, if you delete mail from your Trash folder, the message is deleted on the server.</P>

<P>Eudora has an option that allows you to leave your email messages on the server for a specified number of days. </P>

<P>To transfer all of your new messages from the incoming server to Eudora and also leave copies of those messages on the server, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2.Scroll through the categories and click <B>Incoming Mail</B>.</P>

<P>3.In the Incoming Mail options window, turn on the <B>Leave mail on server</B> option. This options is available only if you are using POP.</P>

<P>4.Select the <B>Delete from server after _ days</B> box and set the maximum number of days the copies of your email messages should be kept on the server. This number is determined by the time it takes for you to check mail from all of your computers. If this number is too small, copies of your mail will not be delivered to all of your computers. </P>

<P><I>Important: Make sure the settings in steps 3 and 4 are identical on all of the computers from which you will be receiving your mail. If you don’t, one computer will delete the mail from the server before you can receive it at another computer.</I></P>

<P>5.Click <B>OK</B> and close the window.</P>

<P>At the next mail check from that computer, Eudora ignores the copies of those previously read messages and looks for new ones. However, if you check mail from another computer, those messages are treated as new and are transferred to that computer.</P>

<P><I>Note:  The "Leave mail on server" option can also be set for each alternate personality you have. To do this, use the Account Settings dialog box, accessed from the Personalities window.</I></P>

<P><I>Important: The "Leave mail on server" option should be used with care, since it can result in a buildup of messages on the POP server.</I></P>

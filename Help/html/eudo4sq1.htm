<P>To look up someone on the Internet, within your company, or in your Eudora Address Book, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Directory Services</B>. Or, if the Directory Services window is an inactive window in a visible tabbed window group, click its tab.</P>

<P>2.In the <B>Databases</B> list, select the database(s) you want to search in your query.</P>

<P>To select a database, click the checkbox to the left of the database until a checkmark appears in the box. You can select multiple databases, and you can use multiple protocols. You must select at least one database in the list in order for Eudora to perform the query. </P>

<P><I>Note: Eudora remembers which databases you’ve selected when you quit and restart the program.</I></P>

<P>3.In the <B>Query</B> field, type a text string you want to search against.</P>

<P>If one or more of your selected databases use a protocol other than Ph, your entry in this field will always be interpreted as a name. If you only have Ph servers selected as your databases, you can enter any commands that Ph will interpret.</P>

<P><I>Note: When looking up names in Eudora’s Directory Services, Eudora now remembers the name and places it in a directory services history file. So whenever you begin typing a name, a drop-down list of names from your history file display alphabetically. Just select the desired name from the list, and the name’s information appears. </I></P>

<P>4.After you’ve typed the text, start the query by pressing <B>Enter</B> or clicking <B>Start</B>.</P>

<P>The query begins, and the Start button changes to <B>Stop</B>.</P>

<P>5.To stop the query before it is completed, click <B>Stop</B>.</P>

<P>When the query is completed, or if you click Stop to cancel the query, the Stop button changes back to Start.</P>

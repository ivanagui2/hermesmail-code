<P>The Automation options let you control and exchange information with Eudora from other programs that support the Windows Automation Interface, such as Microsoft Visual Basic.</P>

<P>Automation gives you external access to Eudora mail folders, mailboxes, and messages, and to the Eudora application itself. With automation enabled, you can create, delete, and move Eudora mail folders, mailboxes, and messages, as well as get notification of these three operations when they are performed manually. You can also get lists of the subfolders under folders and of the messages within mailboxes.</P>

<P>For more information on the automation feature, visit our Web site (click www.eudora.com/developers) where you can find up-to-date automation SDKs (Software Developer’s Kits) and documentation.</P>

<P>To display the Automation options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Automation</B>. The Automation options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below is the field description for Automation:</P>

<P><B>Automation enabled from this machine</B> —— If this option is on, you can perform the automation operations described above from the computer on which Eudora is installed.</P>

<P><B>Warn on Automation auto-send of messages—</B>—<B> </B>If this option is selected, a warning will appear if any message is sent automatically. For example, if you have a message set to be sent a certain time, a warning appears just before the message is sent. Another advantage is that if a virus ever tries to replicate itself using your address book entries, this warning will appear.</P>

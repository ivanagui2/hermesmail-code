<P>General mailbox and folder management for POP and IMAP servers is performed from the Mailboxes window. See <A HREF="eudo6ed3.htm">Using the Mailboxes Window</A> for more information. This section discusses resynchronization.</P>

<P>Keeping your mailboxes and folders remotely on an IMAP server lets you perform operations on them from different computers. For a particular IMAP mailbox, you may delete some messages from the mailbox from one computer; check mail from another computer, resulting in new messages being transferred to the mailbox; and change the status of some of the messages from a third computer.</P>

<P>Each computer has no idea what has been done to the mailbox from the other computer until you resynchronize the mailbox, which updates all operations performed on the mailbox from all computers that have access to the mailbox. In some situations, others may have access to these same mailboxes.</P>

<P>To resynchronize an IMAP mailbox or folder, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Mailboxes</B>, or click the Mailboxes window tab if it is the inactive window in a tabbed group. The Mailboxes window appears.</P>

<P>2.Right-click the mailbox or folder to display the drop-down menu.</P>

<P>3.From the drop-down menu, choose <B>Resynchronize Mailbox</B>. The content of the mailbox or folder is completely updated according to all operations that have been performed on the mailbox from all computers that have access to it.</P>

<P><I>Note: When using the </I>Resynchronize mailbox function <I>on every mailcheck, the icon of the mailbox changes to easily tell which mailboxes will resynchronize on every mailcheck.</I></P>

<P>General mailbox and folder management for POP and IMAP servers is performed from the Mailboxes window. For more information, see <A HREF="eudo6ed3.htm">Using the Mailboxes Window</A>. </P>

<p>General mailbox and folder management for POP and IMAP servers is performed from the Mailboxes window. See <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-000155">Using the Mailboxes Window</a> for more information. This section discusses how to update the list of IMAP mailboxes and folders in the Mailboxes window.</p>

<p>If you have shared folders set up, you and other users can access and change messages stored in mailboxes and folders you keep stored remotely on an IMAP server. However, users may access shared folders only; your personal folders cannot be accessed. The Mailboxes window does not reflect the "real-time" status of the IMAP mailbox list, and between mail checks, a disparity can grow between what appears in the list and what is actually on the IMAP server, as new mailboxes are added and existing ones are changed or removed.</p>

<p>To refresh your list of mailboxes and folders on the IMAP server, as it appears in the Mailboxes window, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Mailboxes</b>, or click the Mailboxes window tab if it is the inactive window in a tabbed group. The Mailboxes window appears.</p>

<p>2.Right-click the top folder in the IMAP tree to display the drop-down menu.</p>

<p>3.From the drop-down menu, choose <b>Refresh Mailbox List</b>. The mailbox list is updated according to what actually appears on the IMAP server at that time. Also, the Mailbox and Transfer menus are updated with the current IMAP mailbox configuration.</p>

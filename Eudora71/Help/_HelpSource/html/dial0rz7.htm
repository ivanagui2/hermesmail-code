<p>The top half of this window is the <b>TOC </b>(Table of Contents), and the bottom half is the <b>Preview Pane</b>. When you check for mail, messages are delivered to your mailboxes with the In mailbox opened in the TOC (If you have no filters set up, all new messages are delivered to your In mailbox).The messages are listed in the order they are received, with the most recent message listed last. Unread messages are designated by a bullet in the Status column of the message summary.</p>

<p>Double-click anywhere on a message summary to open the message. You can also view messages using the message preview pane (see below for details) at the bottom of the mailbox window while the message summary is highlighted. </p>

<p>Incoming messages are saved indefinitely in the In mailbox (or the mailbox they are filtered into) until they are deleted or transferred to another mailbox.</p>

<p>Also, you can select a message in the TOC and transfer it to another mailbox or to the Trash.</p>

<p>Once you select another mailbox, its messages and summaries are displayed in the TOC.</p>

<p>The <b>Preview Pane</b> shows you the full or partial content of a message without opening the message. It is located to the bottom of the list of messages in a mailbox. You can adjust the size of the preview window by placing the cursor on the window frame. Once the cursor changes to a double arrow, you can resize the preview window.</p>

<p>To activate the preview pane, do the following:</p>

<p>1. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2. Scroll and select <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000162">Viewing Mail</a> . The Viewing Mail options window appears.</p>

<p>3. Click the <b>Show message preview pane</b> box.</p>

<p>4. Click OK.</p>

<p>The preview pane shows the key headers and the message body of the currently selected message in the message summary list. If the full message body is not visible in the preview window, scroll bars are displayed, allowing you to view the rest of the message. Only one message can be previewed at a time.</p>

<p>Press <b>Tab</b> or <b>F6</b> to move the keyboard focus from the message summary list to the preview window (and back again). Or simply click in the preview window to put the focus there.</p>

<p>Once keyboard focus is in the preview window, you can do any of the following, as you can in an open incoming message window:</p>

<p>•Press <b>Space</b> to page down through the message.</p>

<p>•Use the arrow keys, as set in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-00018E">Miscellaneous options window</a> (unmodified or with Ctrl or Alt), to switch to the next or previous message in the mailbox.</p>

<p>•Use standard keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl+R for Reply, Ctrl+D for Delete, etc.</p>

<p>•Right-click anywhere in the preview window to display a pop-up menu with commands appropriate for the previewed message.</p>

<p>•Click an attachment icon or name to open the attachment.</p>

<p>•Click a URL (hot link) to launch the application for that URL.</p>

<p>If the <b>Show message preview pane</b> option is turned on in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000162">Viewing Mail options window</a> , you can press <b>F7</b> to show and hide the preview window within the current mailbox only (this does not control the visibility of the preview window in other mailboxes).</p>

<p>If the <b>Show message preview pane</b> option is off in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000162">Viewing Mail options window</a> , only the message summaries are shown in any mailbox window.</p>

<p>If the preview window option is on and the <b>Mark previewed messages as read after _ second(s)</b> option is turned on in the Viewing Mail options window, then the currently previewed message is marked as read (blank in the Status column) after the specified number of seconds. You can always change the message’s status back to Unread (•) by pressing <b>Shift+Space </b>while the message is selected or open (press again to change back to Read). If the <b>Mark previewed</b> option is off, previewed messages are never automatically marked as read.</p>

<p><i>Note:Eudora only performs the auto-marking behavior when you manually switch messages, not when it performs actions such as automatic mail checks or filtering.</i></p>

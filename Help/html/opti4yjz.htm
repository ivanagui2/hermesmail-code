<P>Eudora needs just a few pieces of information in order for you to send and receive mail. Normally you enter this information in the first few windows of the Options windows, but if you like, you can use the Auto Configure options to retrieve these basic settings from an ACAP server. Your email administrator can let you know if such a server is available to you. ACAP, which stands for "Application Configuration Access Protocol," is a communications protocol that lets email and other applications store setup data on and retrieve it from a central server.</P>

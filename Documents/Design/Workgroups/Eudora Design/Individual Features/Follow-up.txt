1.0 Follow-up
	1.1 For motivation and spec, see <http://pobox.com/~djb/proto/replyto.html>
	1.2 Proposal
		1.2.1 Add the follow-up operation
			1.2.1.1 We will then have three operations:
Reply to Author
Reply
Reply to All
				1.2.1.1.1 Reply to Author is our current Reply
				1.2.1.1.2 Reply to All stays the same
				1.2.1.1.3 Reply is the follow-up operation.
			1.2.1.2 Accellerators
				1.2.1.2.1 The user should be able to put <R> on Reply to Author or Reply, but not Reply All.
				1.2.1.2.2 Existing users who have Reply to All as <R> should get cmd-R mapped to Reply.
				1.2.1.2.3 modifier-<R> will do Reply if <R> is mapped to Reply to Author
				1.2.1.2.4 There will be no accellerator for Reply To All
		1.2.2 Figuring out the address list for replies
			1.2.2.1 For each operation, addresses taken from first header found in list.
			1.2.2.2 Reply to Author
				1.2.2.2.1 Mail-Reply-To:
				1.2.2.2.2 Reply-To:
				1.2.2.2.3 From:
			1.2.2.3 Reply
				1.2.2.3.1 Mail-Followup-To:
				1.2.2.3.2 <Reply to All>
			1.2.2.4 Reply to All
				1.2.2.4.1 <Reply-To-Author>+To:+Cc:
		1.2.3 Generation
			1.2.3.1 We will not generate Mail-Reply-To.
			1.2.3.2 We will generate Mail-Followup-To iff any of the addresses in the message belong to a mailing list that MLM knows will send posted mail to the user.
			1.2.3.3 When we generate MFT, it will contain To: and Cc:, duplicate-deleted.

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Replying</B>. The Replying options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Replying:</P>

<P><B>Map Ctrl+R to "Reply to All" —</B>— If this is on, then when you hold down the Ctrl key and press R, a new message is created addressed to all of the recipients of the original message as well as the sender.</P>

<P><B>Copy original’s priority to reply —</B>— If this is on, your replies use the same priority as the original message.</P>

<P><B>Automatically Fcc to original mailbox —</B>— If this is on, replies are automatically copied to the same mailbox that contains the original message<B> </B>with the exception of the In box, whose replies are copied to the Out box.</P>

<P><B>Include signature on reply </B>— If this is selected, your default signature will be included on all of your replies automatically.</P>

<P><B>Quote only the selected text</B>—If this is selected, only the text you highlight in a received message will appear on the reply message.<B> </B></P>

<P><B>When replying to all —</B>— This specifies how to address a reply. If <I>Include yourself </I>is on, when you <I>Reply to all</I> (as described above) your address is left in the address list of the new message and you receive a copy of your own reply. If this option is off (the default), your address is removed from the reply message and you do not receive a copy of the reply. </P>

<P>To determine who you are for the <I>Include yourself</I> option, Eudora uses the "me" nickname. You create the "me" nickname in your Address Book. If you do not have a "me" nickname, Eudora uses the contents of the  Login Name, Mail Server, and Return Address from the Getting Started options. </P>

<P>If <I>Put original To: recipients in Cc:</I> field is on (the default is off), the addresses of the original message recipients are moved from the <I>To</I> field to the <I>Cc</I> field of the reply-to-all message. Only the address of the original sender is placed in the To field. If this option is off, all of the addresses are placed in the <I>To</I> field of the reply message.</P>

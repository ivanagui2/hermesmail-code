<H1><A NAME="configuring_eudora"></A>Configuring Eudora</H1>

<P>To configure Eudora, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Install Eudora and restart your computer.</P>

<P>2.Double-click the Eudora icon to open it. If you are installing Eudora for the first time, the <B>New Account Wizard </B>opens, showing the welcome screen. </P>

<P>3.Click <B>Next </B>to begin setting up your new email account.</P>

<P>4.Select an appropriate method of setting up your account: </P>

<P>a.Create a brand new email account (go to step 7).  Select this method to set up a new account if you are not familiar with Eudora or other email programs. You are prompted to enter one piece of information per window.</P>

<P>b.Import settings from an existing email account (go to step 5). Select this method if you want to import your settings, mail, and address book from Outlook Express™ 5.0, Outlook 98™, Outlook 2000™, or Netscape Messenger™ 4.x, and higher into Eudora. <BR>
<BR>
If you need more information on migrating settings from another email program to Eudora, see <U>Importing Settings to Create a New Account</U>. Note that this process may take some time depending on the amount of mail, the complexity of your settings, and the size of your address book.</P>

<P>c.Instruct Eudora to get your settings from an ACAP server (go to step 6). Select this method to instruct Eudora to attempt to get your settings from an ACAP server. To get your settings from an ACAP server, make sure that you are connected to the Internet. Your email administrator or Internet Service Provider (ISP) can tell you whether an ACAP based setup is available to you.</P>

<P>d.Create a new account using the advanced account setup. Select this method if you are familiar with Eudora or other email programs. An Account Settings window appears with two tabbed panels. Enter all of your Eudora information on these panels. Go to <A HREF="eudo19gn.htm">Account Settings Dialog</A>.</P>

<P>5. If you choose to import settings from an existing email account, and select the account and click <B>Next</B>. Eudora asks you to confirm the settings and optionally change them. If you choose <B>No</B> and click <B>Next</B>, your account is set up when you click <B>Finish</B> in the final window. If you choose <B>Yes</B> and click <B>Next</B>, the New Account wizard walks you through the fields to be changed as described further below. When you click <B>Finish</B> in the final window, your new account is set up.</P>

<P>6. If you choose the ACAP option and click <B>Next</B>, the Auto Configure window appears. Click <B>Next</B> again to instruct Eudora to get your account settings from the ACAP server. If the attempt fails, click <B>Back</B> and try one of the other options. </P>

<P>7. If in the Account Setup window you choose to create a brand new email account and click <B>Next</B>, the New Account Wizard begins guiding you through the fields for which you need to enter setup information.</P>

<P>8. In the windows of the New Account wizard, enter the following field information (click <B>Next</B> after filling out each window):</P>

<P>•<B>Your Name</B> — Enter your name as you would like it to appear in the <B>From</B> field of all of your outgoing messages from this email account, to indicate to your recipients whom the mail is from.</P>

<P>•<B>Email Address</B> — Enter the email address that has been assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider or your email administrator. This is the address that other people will use to send you email. Email addresses are generally in the form <I>loginname@domainname</I>, for example, <B>beatrixp@myfirm.com</B>.</P>

<P>•<B>User Name</B> — Enter the name that you will use to log in to this email account, if required. This name is provided by your Internet Service Provider or your email administrator, and it usually consists of the text that appears before the at sign (@) in your email address. In the example <B>jcamp@myfirm.com</B>, the user name is <B>jcamp</B>.</P>

<P>•<B>Incoming E-mail Server</B> — All of your incoming email messages are delivered to your incoming email account, which resides on a computer that runs your incoming email server. When your messages arrive at your mail account, Eudora picks them up and transfers them to your computer. Your incoming email server must use one of the two Internet mail communications protocols <B>IMAP</B> (Internet Message Access Protocol) or <B>POP</B> (Post Office Protocol). If you are not sure which protocol it uses, select POP; you can always change this later. In the edit box, type the full name of the computer that runs your incoming email server; <B>jcamp.myfirm.com</B> is an example.</P>

<P>•If you chose <B>IMAP</B> in the previous setup window, an <B>IMAP Mailbox Location Prefix</B> may be required to indicate the location of your personal mailboxes on the IMAP server. If so, enter the name of that location prefix as given to you by your Internet Service Provider or email administrator. If the information is not required, leave the field blank. Click <B>Next</B>, then in the last window, click <B>Finish</B>. Your new IMAP email account is set up.</P>

<P>If you chose <B>POP</B> in the previous setup window, click <B>Finish</B> in the final window and your new POP email account is set up.</P>

<P>When you have finished setting up your account via the New Account wizard, you are now ready to receive messages. However, you may need to take an additional step in order to <I>send</I> messages.</P>

<P>To send messages in Eudora, you must have access to a computer running an <B>SMTP</B> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. Your outgoing messages are sent to the SMTP server, which delivers them to your recipients.</P>

<P>If the computer that runs your POP or IMAP server (incoming email account) also runs an SMTP server, then no additional setup action is required. You are now ready to send and receive messages in Eudora.</P>

<P>If, however, your SMTP server runs on a <I>different</I> computer from the one running your POP or IMAP server, take the following final setup action (you may want to consult your Internet Service Provider or email administrator to help you set up the SMTP server).</P>

<P>To set up your SMTP server, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll through the icons, and choose <B>Sending Mail</B>. </P>

<P>3.In the <B>SMTP server</B> field, enter the full name of the computer that runs your SMTP (outgoing) server, for example: smtp.myfirm.com. </P>

<P>4.To save your settings and close the Options dialog box, click <B>OK</B>. You are now ready to send and receive mail in Eudora.</P>

<P>If you ever wish to change the settings of your email account, you can do so from the Options dialog box. </P>

<P>You can also change these settings in the Account Settings dialog, which is accessed from the Personalities window. This window also lets you create alternate email accounts and edit the settings in those accounts. For more details, see the sections <A HREF="eudo6et0.htm">Using an Alternate E-mail Account</A>, <A HREF="eudo6lrr.htm">Personalities Window</A>, and <A HREF="eudo19gn.htm">Account Settings Dialog</A>.</P>

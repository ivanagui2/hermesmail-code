<h2><a name="getting_started_options_window"></a>Getting Started Options Window</h2>

<p>On the Getting Started options window, you can determine the minimum information necessary to send and receive mail. The information here is for your "dominant" personality, which is your principal email account.</p>

<p>For your convenience, some fields appear in more than one category. For example, your return address appears in both the Getting Started options window and the Incoming Mail options window. Changing an option in one category changes the option in all categories in which it appears.</p>

<p>To display the Getting Started options window, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools</b> menu, select <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2.Click <b>Getting Started</b>. The Getting Started options window appears.</p>

<p>Listed below are field descriptions for Getting Started:</p>

<p><b>Real name</b>—This is the real name assigned to your principal account generally your first and last name. The text you enter here is included in the From field of all your outgoing messages from this account, and identifies to your recipients who the mail is from.</p>

<p><b>Email address</b>—This is the return email address used in outgoing messages and recipients’ replies, if this address is different from your incoming mail account. The address you enter here is included in the From field of all your outgoing messages from this account, and when a recipient replies to a message from this account, the reply is sent to this address. If you do not enter an address in this field, Eudora uses your incoming mail account as the return address. Incoming mail accounts are usually of the form <i>loginname@incomingmailserver</i>. For example, suppose your incoming mail account is <i>beatrixp@wabbits.myfirm.com</i> but your return address is <i>beatrixp@myfirm.com</i> slightly different. You would then enter <i>beatrixp@myfirm.com</i> in this field.</p>

<p>If you do enter an address in this field, first test the address to be sure that mail sent to it is indeed delivered to you. If you use an invalid return address, no one will be able to reply to your mail.</p>

<p><b>Mail Server (Incoming)</b>—This is the name of the incoming-mail server for your principal email account. All incoming messages to your primary account are routed through this server. Use the Incoming Mail options window to specify whether this server uses POP (Post Office Protocol) or IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). A sample server name might be <i>popserver.myfirm.com</i>.</p>

<p><b>User  Name</b>—This is the name you use to log in to your primary email account, for accounts that require a user login. For example, in the incoming mail account <i>beatrixp@wabbits.myfirm.com</i>, the user name is <i>beatrixp</i>.</p>

<p><b>SMTP server (outgoing) —</b>— This is the name of the outgoing mail server for your principal email account. All outgoing messages sent from your primary account are routed through this server. If the computer that your primary incoming mail account is on also runs an SMTP server, you can leave this field blank. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.</p>

<p><b>Allow authentication— </b>Eudora can log in to an SMTP server when sending mail, just like it does for receiving mail. Not all SMTP servers require or allow such authentication. Eudora will attempt authentication to servers that allow it. The preferred SMTP authentication method is CRAM-MD5. If CRAM-MD5 is not available, LOGIN or PLAIN will automatically be used.<b> </b></p>

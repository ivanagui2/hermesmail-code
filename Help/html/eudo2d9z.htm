<P>The Styled Text options determine when to use style information in outgoing and incoming messages.</P>

<P>To display the Styled Text options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Styled Text</B>. The Styled Text options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Styled Text:</P>

<P><B>Show formatting toolbar —</B>— If this is on, the formatting toolbar displays by default in new message windows. If this is off, the formatting toolbar is hidden by default in new message windows. This toolbar lets you easily format text styles in new messages.</P>

<P><B>When sending mail with styled text (HTML)</B> —— This specifies what to do with HTML text styles when you send mail. The styles are delivered to your recipients using the HyperText Marking Language (HTML) format. However, the styles your recipient sees depends on how well their email software supports this standard. </P>

<P>HTML is the text formatting standard used in the World Wide Web by Web browsers and newer email applications. HTML allows you to use enriched text, which includes different fonts, color, sizes, bold, and so forth. Also, HTML lets you embed pictures and create bullet lists in the emails you send.</P>

<P><B>Send both plain and styled, Send styled text only, Send plain text only —</B>— These options apply only to messages that have some styled content. Plain text messages are always sent as just plain text. If a message has styled text, then these options control which versions of the message are sent: an HTML version, a plain text version, or both an HTML and a plain text version in the same message.</P>

<P>If you send plain and styled text, then your recipient will be able to view your message regardless whether their email program supports HTML viewing. If HTML viewing is not supported, then the message is viewed in plain text; otherwise, it is viewed in HTML.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Ask me each time</B> —— If this is on, you are warned when you try to send or queue a message with text styles. And you are given the option to send a plain text version, an HTML version, or both in a single message.</P>

<P><B>When the body of a message has no styles, but the signature does have styles: Send the signature with styles </B>— If this is selected, a signature with styled text is sent with a message that has no styled text. If this is deselected, then the signature is sent but the text styles are removed.</P>

<P><I>Note. If selected, the signature becomes part of the message text. However, if an attachment is included with your message, this option turns off. </I></P>

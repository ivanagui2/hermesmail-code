<P>If you send an attachment and your recipient’s email program does not correctly decode it, it will probably be included in the body of the message in the chosen attachment format (MIME, BinHex, or Uuencode).</P>

<P>If you receive a large message consisting largely of indecipherable text, it is probably an attachment that was not automatically decoded. Usually this is because the attachment headers are formatted incorrectly.</P>

<P>To decode an attachment that was not automatically decoded, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Open the message.</P>

<P>2. From the <B>File</B> menu, choose <B>Save As</B> to save the message as a text file. </P>

<P>3. Run the decoding utility for the encoding method that the sender used. Decoding utilities can be found at various shareware sites on the Internet.</P>

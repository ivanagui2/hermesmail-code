<P>If this is off, Eudora uses the "Disposition-Notification-To:" header in return receipt requests to request that you be sent a notification when your message appears by the recipient. If this is on, Eudora also sends the "Return-Receipt-To:" header in return receipt requests. This header is understood by some older mail delivery systems, and may return you a receipt when your message is delivered to your recipient’s mailbox. The "Return-Receipt-To:" header cannot give you any information about whether or not your recipient displayed your mail, and is not supported by many newer mail delivery systems.</P>

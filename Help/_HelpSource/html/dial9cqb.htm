<p><b><a name="hidr_personalities"></a><sup></sup>Personalities</b></p>

<p>Use this window to manage, access, and apply your email accounts —  "multiple personalities" — when you use more than one account.</p>

<p>The Personalities window displays two columns of data:</p>

<p>•<b>Persona</b> — The identifying name assigned to the personality. &lt;Dominant<b>&gt;</b> indicates your principal email account, which is the account HERMES uses whenever you don’t specify otherwise, and is the account associated with all mail stored before you began using alternate personalities.</p>

<p>•<b>Account</b> — The incoming mail account assigned to the personality. This is generally in the form <i>loginname@incomingmailserver</i></p>

<p>To resize the column widths, position the pointer over the divider line between the column headings, until a splitter cursor appears. Then just drag the divider to left or right. Note that it is possible to completely collapse the Persona column.</p>

<p><i>Note:You cannot manually sort the information in the Personalities window. Clicking on a column heading does not do a sort </i></p>

<p><i>Note:You can select multiple items in the Persona column to perform some of the operations listed below. Use the Shift key to select a range of items, and use the <b>Ctrl</b> key to make non-consecutive selections.</i></p>

<p>If you select one or more personalities in the Persona column and right-click the selection, a context menu appears with the following commands (the standard HERMES window-management commands appear at the bottom):</p>

<p>•<b>Check Mail</b> — Check mail now for all selected personalities.</p>

<p>•<b>Send Queued Messages</b> — Send messages queued by all selected personalities now.</p>

<p>•<b>Message</b> — This submenu lets you perform message-creation functions using only <i>one</i> selected personality. The submenu is unavailable if multiple personalities are selected in the Persona column. </p>

<p>-<b>New Message As</b> — Create a new message as the selected personality. As a shortcut for this command, double-click a personality in the Persona column, or select the personality and press Enter.</p>

<p>-<b>Reply As</b> — Reply as the selected personality to the sender(s) of the one or more received messages that are currently selected.</p>

<p>-<b>Reply to All As</b> — Reply as the selected personality to the sender(s) and all recipients of the one or more received messages that are currently selected.</p>

<p>-<b>Forward As</b> — Forward as the selected personality the one or more received messages that are currently selected.</p>

<p>-<b>Redirect As</b> — Redirect as the selected personality the one or more received messages that are currently selected.</p>

<p>-<b>Send Again As</b> — Resend as the selected personality the one or more received or composition messages that are currently selected.</p>

<p>•<b>New</b> — Create a new personality. When you select this command, HERMES walks you through the New Account Wizard. Enter a Personality Name (e.g., My Laptop Account) and click Next. You then have the choice to create a new email account or import the settings from an existing email account. If you choose a new email account, HERMES prompts you for your name, your return email address, your login name, and your incoming email server (POP or IMAP). Fill in each item as instructed. If you choose to import the settings from an existing email, HERMES asks you to choose the account to import, then asks you to confirm the settings and optionally change them. If you leave them unchanged, the imported account is created when you click Finish. If you choose to change them, HERMES walks you through the settings as above: name, return address, login name, and incoming email server. Change these settings as desired, and when you are complete, the new account is created.</p>

<p>•<b>Properties</b> — Modify the selected personality. You can only modify one personality at a time. When you select this command, the Account Settings dialog displays, with its fields filled in with the information associated with that personality. See the description of this dialog box below.</p>

<p>•<b>Delete</b> — Delete all selected personalities. Note, however, that you <i>cannot</i> delete the &lt;Dominant&gt; personality. You are prompted to confirm the deletion for each personality you have selected to delete. Note that these deletions are <i>permanent</i> and <i>cannot</i> be undone! When you delete a personality, any messages associated with that personality are reassigned to your Dominant personality. You can use the Del key (Delete) as a shortcut for this command (you will still get the confirmation requests).</p>

<p>You can also display the context menu and create a new personality by right-clicking in a blank area of the Personalities window, <i>off</i> all personality items, when none of the items are selected. When creating a new personality this way, you are walked through the New Account Wizard as in the description of the New command above.</p>

<p>If you drag one or more received messages to a personality item in the Personalities window, HERMES will Reply As that personality to the messages (hold down the Ctrl key to Reply to All As).</p>

<P>A signature is a few lines of text that is added automatically to the end of an outgoing message when it is sent. A signature can be whatever you want, but it is mostly used to give contact information (telephone, address, etc.). You use only one signature at a time in a message, but you can create as many different signatures as you want.</P>

<P>You can choose to show or hide your signature when composing a messages. From the Options menu, go to the Composing Mail options window. You can turn the <I>Show signature when composing</I> option on or off. </P>

<P>The Signature window displays a single-column list of your signature files.</P>

<P><I>Note:You can select only one item at a time in the list; you cannot select multiple items.</I></P>

<P>If you right-click a signature in the list, a context menu appears with the following commands (the standard Eudora window-management commands appear at the bottom):</P>

<P>•<B>New</B> — Create a new signature. Eudora prompts you for the name of the new signature, then opens an editing window for you to type the signature text. Save the text with the File menu Save command, or close without saving to discard.</P>

<P>•<B>Edit</B> — Open an editing window for the selected signature. Double-click a signature as a shortcut for this command. Save your changes with the File menu Save command, or close the window without saving to discard your changes.</P>

<P>•<B>Delete</B> — Delete the selected signature. Eudora asks you to confirm the deletion. Use the Del key (<B>Delete</B>) as a shortcut for this command.</P>

<P>•<B>Rename</B> — Rename the selected signature. Use the F2 key as a shortcut for this command, or click the signature item’s name box, then edit the name right in the box.</P>

<P>You can also display the context menu and create a new signature by right-clicking anywhere in an empty Signature window or by right-clicking anywhere <I>off</I> a signature item in a non-empty Signature window.</P>

; This file defines configuration data defined for the user by their system administrator.
; This configuration data defines how the Finger protocol driver is initialized when no 
; configuration data is present in the registry at startup.
;
; Note:
;
; 1) This file MUST appear in the same directory as the PH.DLL (finger) for it to work.
;
; 2) This file is ignored if the current LDAP client contains any existing configuration data.
;    If the user deletes all configuration data in the registry and then brings up the directory application
;    again then this data will be loaded.
;
; Format:
;
;    Sections-
;
;    [General]
;       ServerCount     This key identifie the number of servers that will be configured 
;                       by this file. This key must be present and set to a value greater 
;                       than zero for this file to have any effect.
;
;    The following sections are of the format: [Finger.(n)] where (n) identifies the zero-based
;    index of the server. For example, if the 'ServerCount' key above has the value of 2, there
;    would be 2 sections, [Finger.0] and [Finger.1]
;
;    [Finger.(n)]
;       HostName        The network host name of this server, e.g. "smtphost.qualcomm.com".

;       ServerName      The user-friendly name with which this server will be identified.

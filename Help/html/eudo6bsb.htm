<P>You can open and address a new message from the Address Book using the <B>To</B>, <B>Cc</B>, and <B>Bcc</B> buttons.</P>

<P>To create a new message from the Address Book, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Select the entry you want to address the mail to (hold down the Shift key to select multiple entries in sequence, or the Ctrl key to make nonconsecutive selections). </P>

<P>2. Click <B>To</B>, <B>Cc</B>, or <B>Bcc</B>. A new composition window appears with the selected nickname(s) inserted in the appropriate field.</P>

<P><I>Note:You can also double-click an entry to enter that nickname in a header field. If no composition window is open, a new composition window is opened and the nickname is entered in the To field. If a composition window is open when you double-click, the nickname is entered in the header field that last had keyboard focus.</I></P>

<P>To address the message with the completely expanded address or addresses for that entry, rather than the entry’s nickname (the addresses are listed in the Address(es) field for the entry), turn on the <B>Expand Nickname</B> option.</P>

<P>Once the composition window appears, you can use the <B>To,</B> <B>Cc</B>, and <B>Bcc </B>buttons to insert additional nicknames into the corresponding fields, subject to the following restrictions.</P>

<P>If the Address Book is a docked or floating window (either alone or as part of a tabbed window group), the <B>To</B>, <B>Cc</B>, and <B>Bcc</B> buttons apply to the topmost composition window, if any. If the Address Book is a normal window (either alone or as part of a tabbed window group), the <B>To</B>, <B>Cc</B>, and <B>Bcc</B> buttons apply to the composition window, if any, that is immediately under either the Address Book or the tabbed window group containing the Address Book. For more information on docked, floating, normal, and tabbed windows, see <A HREF="eudo1pv7.htm">Window States and Tabbed Windows</A> .</P>

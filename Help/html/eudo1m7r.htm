<P>The Extra Warnings options determine whether you are warned before making a possible mistake. Most of the warnings are displayed with an option to stop that warning from being displayed again. You can toggle warnings to be either on or off.</P>

<P>To display the Extra Warnings options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Extra Warnings</B>. The Extra Warnings options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Extra Warnings:</P>

<P><B>Delete unread mail</B> —— If this is on, you are warned if you try to delete mail that is marked unread.</P>

<P><B>Delete queued mail</B> —— If this is on, you are warned if you try to delete mail that is queued to be sent (marked "Q," or clock icon for timed-queue) in the Out mailbox.</P>

<P><B>Delete unsent mail</B> —— If this is on, you are warned if you try to delete messages that are marked sendable (with a bullet in the Out mailbox) but not yet sent.</P>

<P><B>Queue a message with no subject</B> —— If this is on, you are warned if you try to queue a message that contains no text in the Subject line. It is considered a point of email etiquette to give each message a subject.</P>

<P><B>Queue a message bigger than _ K</B> [default: 500] —— If this is on, you are warned if you try to queue or send a message that is greater in size than the specified number. This number must be between 0 and 1000000 (one million, no commas).</P>

<P><B>Quit with messages queued to be sent —</B>— If this is on, you are warned if you try to quit Eudora while there are still queued messages in your Out mailbox.</P>

<P><B>Empty the Trash mailbox</B> —— If this is on, you are warned if you try to empty the Trash mailbox (one way is with the Special menu Empty Trash command). Once messages are deleted from the Trash, they are completely gone from your system.</P>

<P><B>Start Eudora and it’s not the default mailer</B> —— If this is on, you are warned if you try to start Eudora when it’s not the default mailer. When Eudora is the default mailer, "mailto:" commands open a Eudora message, regardless of what application the command is in.</P>

<P><B>Switch views for Find</B> —— If this is selected, you are warned if you try to perform a Find operation (using the Edit menu Find submenu) while viewing an incoming message using the Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 4.0 viewer. The warning indicates that Eudora will switch to a different viewer to complete the Find operation. Eudora uses IE as the default viewer if  IE is installed on your system and the "Use Microsoft’s viewer" option is selected in the Viewing Mail options. See <A HREF="eudo6szb.htm">Viewing Mail Options Window</A> .</P>

<P><B>Launch a program from a message </B>— If this is selected, you are warned if you try to launch a program from a message. For security reasons, you should never launch a program without performing a virus check on the file. Do not launch any program if you do not know sender. Some viruses can infect a file without your knowing it. It is always good to perform regular virus checks using a current virus checking program.</P>

<P><B>Launch a program externally </B>— If this is selected, you are warned if you try to launch an attachment or program outside of Eudora, for example directly from the Attachments directory or from a Eudora Sharing Protocol (ESP) directory. For security reasons, you should never launch a program without performing a virus check on the file. Do not launch any program or open an attachment if you do not know sender. Some viruses can infect a file without your knowing it. It is always good to perform regular virus checks using a current virus checking program.</P>

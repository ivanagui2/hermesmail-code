<P>Every group member needs a shared folder on his or her hard drive to store documents, schedules, messages, illustrations, images, or any other file the members deem necessary for sharing. ESP allows you and your group members to determine how often ESP checks each member’s shared folder for updates, and how the information in the shared folders is backed up.</P>

<P>To configure shared folder settings for your group, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose<B> ESP Groups</B>. The ESP Groups window appears.</P>

<P>2.In the left column, choose the Group name whose shared folders you want to set. </P>

<P>3.Click the <B>Settings</B> tab. The Settings dialog box appears.</P>

<P>4.Check the <B>Check shared folder for changes every _ minutes</B> box and specify the time interval at which you want ESP to check the shared folder for group updates. If this option is not checked, ESP won’t check the shared folder. The system default is for ESP to check the shared folder every 10 minutes.</P>

<P>5.If you want ESP to automatically create a backup when other members update files in the shared folder, check the<B> Auto-Backup updated documents</B> box. The box is checked by default.</P>

<P>6.If you want ESP to automatically back up deleted documents from the shared folder, check the <B>Auto-Backup deleted documents</B> box. The box is checked by default.</P>

<P>7.In the <B>Store up to _ previous versions</B> text box, indicate the number of previous document versions you want Eudora to store. The system default is one version.</P>

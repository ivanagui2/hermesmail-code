<P>Although ESP is a valuable tool for you and your group when working on the same document or file, there are some limitations. Here are a few tips on using ESP that will make working on group files more efficient.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Do</B> realize that the ESP folder is shared. If you take a file out of the shared folder, it will be removed from each member's shared folder.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Do</B> invite people to be in your group. Some of them might have to become familiar with ESP before becoming full members. As they are gaining experience, tell them how to become full members.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Do</B> use ESP to keep a shared list of current email addresses for group mailings. ESP updates email addresses when you change the email address for a personality. When saved in the ESP Group window, ESP asks you if you want to update both your ESP's information and other members' information or just update your ESP information. If you choose both, an email message is sent to all group members and automatically updates your changed email address.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Do</B> use ESP as a mini-mailing list for, perhaps, a family, group of friends, coworkers and so on. The list of email addresses stays current in all of the members' lists when the addresses are modified.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Don't</B> put large files in ESP. Other members of your group may have mail systems with limits on file size.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Don't </B>put files in ESP where group members need to work on them at the same time. ESP works best when one member works on one file at a time.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Don't</B> put files in ESP that need to be updated in realtime. There will be a few minute delay in updated group files.</P>

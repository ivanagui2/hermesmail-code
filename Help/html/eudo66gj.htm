<P>The message summaries in mailboxes are automatically sorted by date, in ascending order (the newest messages at the bottom of the mailbox). To change this, select the appropriate command from the <B>Sort</B> submenu under the <B>Edit</B> menu. Or, click any of the column headings to sort by that column. To sort in descending order, hold down the <B>Shift</B> key and either select a command from the <B>Sort</B> submenu or click the column headings.</P>

<P>Mailboxes are sorted based on the previous state of the mailbox. For example, if a mailbox is sorted by Date, and then you sort by Sender, the messages are grouped by sender and each group is in order by date.</P>

<P><I>Note:Sometimes sorting by Date can be incorrect. This usually happens if the messages have incorrectly formatted date fields, or unknown or incorrect time zones.</I></P>

<P>See the <A HREF="eudo0ud3.htm">Date Display options window</A> for information on age-sensitive indications that might appear in the Date column, such as the day of the week or "Today."</P>

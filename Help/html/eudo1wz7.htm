<P>A window is said to be in the <I>floating</I> state if it floats above the main Eudora window and can be placed anywhere on the desktop, including outside the main Eudora window. In this way a floating window is a standard Windows "Always on Top" window, like tool palettes in paint programs.</P>

<P>Only tool windows as described in <A HREF="eudo1pv7.htm">Window States and Tabbed Windows</A>, whether alone or tabbed, can be made to float. All other windows in Eudora, particularly message windows and mailbox windows, <I>cannot</I> be made to float.</P>

<P>All windows in Eudora can be thought of as "living" in one of three layers or areas:</P>

<P>•Normal windows live in the window work area, at the bottom layer.</P>

<P>•Docked windows live at the level of the main Eudora window’s border, the middle layer.</P>

<P>•Floating windows live at the level above the main Eudora window, the top layer.</P>

<P>Therefore, a floating Eudora window floats above all other Eudora windows except other floating windows.</P>

<P>The title bar of a floating window contains, in addition to the title, only the close button. This distinguishes the window from a normal window when both appear to be in the window work area; a normal window’s title bar contains the window-menu icon (left) and three buttons. But also note that a floating window can be dragged outside of the main Eudora window, whereas a normal window cannot.</P>

<P>You can diagonally resize any floating window in Eudora. Simply position the pointer over any window corner, and click and drag to enlarge or reduce.</P>

<P>To convert a window to a floating window, either undock it from the main window, if it is docked, or do the following: right-click the window’s border or tab, make sure the <B>Float In Main Window</B> command is unchecked (turned off) on the context menu (right-click), then turn off (uncheck) the <B>Allow Docking</B> command on the menu. For a docked window, you can also temporarily override the <B>Allow Docking</B> command and suspend docking by holding down the <B>Ctrl</B> key while dragging the window. The window drags as a floating window. </P>

<P>There are several options for replying to messages.</P>

<P>To include everyone who received the original message, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the Message menu, choose <B>Reply to All</B>.</P>

<P>To include yourself as a recipient, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Open the <B>Tools</B> menu and choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and select <B>Replying</B>. The Replying dialog box appears.</P>

<P>3. Check the <B>Include yourself</B> box and click OK. This only works if you are using <B>Reply to All</B>.</P>

<P><I>Note:To determine who you are for the <B>Include yourself</B> option, Eudora uses the "me" nickname. If you do not have a "me" nickname set up in your Address Book, Eudora uses the contents of the <B>Mail Server (Incoming)</B>, <B>User Name</B>, and <B>Email  address</B> fields from the<U> Getting Started Options Window</U>. (Incoming mail accounts are usually of the form <B>username@mailservername</B>.) The "me" nickname is particularly useful if you have multiple addresses and don’t want replies to go to any of those addresses.</I></P>

<P>To put the addresses of the other recipients of the original message in the <B>Cc</B> field (instead of the <B>To</B> field), do the following:</P>

<P>1. Open the <B>Tools</B> menu and choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and select <B>Replying</B>. The Replying dialog box appears.</P>

<P>3. Check the <B>Put original To: recipients in Cc: field </B>box and click OK. Only the original sender’s address is put in the <B>To</B> field. This works only if you are using <B>Reply to All</B>.</P>

<P>To copy the original message’s priority to your replies, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Open the <B>Tools</B> menu and choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and select <B>Replying</B>. The Replying dialog box appears.</P>

<P>3. Check the <B>Copy original’s priority to reply </B>box in the <A HREF="eudo3zuf.htm">Replying Options Window</A>.</P>

<P>To change the keyboard shortcut <B>Ctrl+R</B> from its normal function of <B>Reply</B> to <B>Reply to All</B>, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Open the <B>Tools</B> menu and choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and select <B>Replying</B>. The Replying dialog box appears.</P>

<P>3. Check the <B>Map Ctrl+R to "Reply to All"</B> box in the Replying dialog box. The change is reflected on the Message menu.</P>

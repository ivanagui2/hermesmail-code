<h2><a name="filter_actions"></a>Filter Actions</h2>

<p>For a filter you’re creating or modifying in the Filters window, all messages that match the filter criteria are acted on as specified with the <b>Actions</b> drop-downs. Each filter can do up to five things to a message that matches the criteria. You can use the same action twice if it does not directly affect the original message (for example, <b>Copy To</b> can be used twice, but not <b>Transfer To</b>).</p>

<p>Some filter actions have an associated icon. For these actions, Eudora places the action icon next to the filter in the filters list. Up to five icons can appear per filter.</p>

<p>The Actions options are as follows:</p>

<p><b>None —</b><b>—</b><b> </b>No action</p>

<p><b>Make Status —</b>— Assigns the selected status to message summaries.</p>

<p><b>Make Priority</b> —— Assigns the selected priority level to messages. If you select a set level, messages are set to that priority. If you select<b> Raise </b>or <b>Lower</b>, messages are raised or lowered one priority level based on their prefilter level.</p>

<p><b>Make Label </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—— Assigns the selected label to messages. Label colors and names are set in the Labels options window.</p>

<p><b>Make Personality </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—— Assigns the selected personality to messages. For outgoing messages, the message is sent from the assigned personality. For incoming messages, all your responses to the message will be from the assigned personality until you change the personality associated with the incoming message or your response. For more information, see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000156">Using an Alternate Email Account</a> .</p>

<p><b>Make Subject</b> —— Assigns the new subject to message summaries (does not affect the subject in the message itself). If you choose this option, the entire subject of the message is replaced with the new subject. Use the "&amp;" symbol to stand for the old subject if you want to add the new subject to the old subject. For example, entering<b> New Subject [was &amp;] </b>results in<b> New Subject [was Old Subject]</b>.</p>

<p><b>Play Sound —</b><b>—</b><b> </b>Plays the selected sound when messages are filtered.</p>

<p><b>Speak </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—— A voice makes you aware when a certain email message is retrieved. The voice can read the name of the sender and the subject line of the message, if you so choose. Also, you can select the type of voice you prefer from a drop-down list that appears. After you select Speak, the Who and Subject fields and a drop-down voice list appear. If these fields are grayed out,  you need to install SAPI and Mircrosoft’s text-to-speech engine. The installers are both available at: www.eudora.com/download/other.  <code> </code></p>

<p><b>Open </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—<b>—</b><b> </b>Opens the<b> Mailbox </b>and/or<b> Message </b>when a message is received. If you set a previous action to filter messages into a mailbox, then that mailbox is opened.</p>

<p><b>Print </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—<b>—</b><b> </b>Prints one copy of each message.</p>

<p><b>Notify User </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—<b>—</b><b> </b>Notifies you<b> As Normal </b>and/or<b> In Report </b>when messages are received. The<b> As Normal </b>option notifies you based on the options you have selected in the <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000189">Getting Attention</a> options window. The<b> In Report </b>option notifies you by opening the Filter Report window and displaying in that window a filter report that details what filter actions have been done. See<b> </b><a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-000187">Filter Report<b> </b>Window</a> .</p>

<p><b>Notify Application —</b><b>—</b><b> </b>Notifies the selected application when messages are received, and provides information from the message. Specify the application to use and the part of the message to be included.</p>

<p>Use the Browse button to select an application, or enter the command line yourself. The command line should include the path to the executable file, any options, and the following substitution variables, all separated by blank spaces:</p>

<p>%1Date<br />
%2To<br />
%3From<br />
%4Subject<br />
%5Cc<br />
%6The entire message</p>

<p>For example, the command line to send the subject of a message to a pager might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>    C:\apps\pager.exe -c %4</code></pre>

<p><b>Forward To </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)—<b>—</b><b> </b>Forwards messages to the email address given. Forwarded messages are placed in the queue in the Out mailbox, and sent the next time you send queued messages.</p>

<p><b>Redirect To </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)——  Redirects messages to the email address given. Redirected messages are placed in the queue in the Out mailbox, and sent the next time you send queued messages.</p>

<p><b>Reply with —</b>— Replies to messages with the selected stationery message. Replies are placed in the queue in the Out mailbox and sent the next time you send queued messages. For more details, see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-0000FA">Using Stationery</a> .</p>

<p><b>Server Options </b>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)<b> —</b>— Sets the message’s server status to Fetch and/or Delete (POP server only: see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-00018B">Managing your Mail on a POP Server.</a>). Sets the message’s server status to Fetch and/or Delete (incoming server only). The Fetch option specifies that the entire message be transferred from the server the next time mail is checked, and the Delete option specifies that the message be deleted from the server the next time mail is checked. If you select both, the message will be transferred and deleted.</p>

<p><b>Copy To</b> —— Copies messages to the selected mailbox.</p>

<p><b>Transfer To —</b>— Transfers messages to the selected mailbox.</p>

<p><b>Skip Rest —</b><b>—</b><b> </b>Stops filtering for the message (the message is not matched to the rest of the filters in the filter list).</p>

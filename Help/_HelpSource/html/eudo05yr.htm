<h2><a name="background_tasks"></a>Background Tasks</h2>

<p>In HERMES, you can retrieve, send, and compose mail at the same time! While sending and retrieving mail, you can compose a message, access Directory Services to look up addresses, edit stationery and signatures, read mail, and so forth because retrieving and sending mail now occurs in the background. </p>

<p>The Task Status window displays sending and receiving activity as it happens. For example, when you check and send mail simultaneously, the progress of these functions is displayed in the Task Status window. Also, you can send messages from different personalities at the same time. See <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-0000D5">Task Status Window</a>.</p>

<p>The Background Tasks options found in Options under the Tools menu allow you to set parameters that determine how background tasks behave, and what kind of information you want to see in the Task Status window. In other words, you can configure the behavior of background tasks. Also, you can set the Task Status and/or the Task Error windows to be brought to the front of other windows in HERMES when activity occurs.</p>

<p>In the Background Tasks options window, you can indicate the number of seconds of user inactivity before your newly retrieved mail is actually processed by HERMES. If you have automatic mail checking set up in the Checking Mail options, HERMES will retrieve the mail in the background from the incoming server at those time intervals. But HERMES will not process it until there is no user activity performed on your computer for the amount of seconds you indicate in the Background Tasks options window. An envelope displayed on the status bar, located at the lower right-hand corner of the HERMES window, indicates that there is retrieved mail to be processed, that is, messages to be filtered and placed in mailboxes.</p>

<p><b><i>Technical Note.</i></b> In the background, HERMES retrieves and sends mail; in the foreground, HERMES processes attachments and applies filters.</p>

<p>If you check your mail manually, it is retrieved from the server immediately and delivered to HERMES without waiting for user inactivity. However, if you do a manual check and then perform a task in HERMES while HERMES is retrieving your mail, HERMES will wait for user inactivity before processing your newly retrieved mail. When this occurs, the envelope displays on the status bar until the user inactivity time specified has been reached.</p>

<p><i>Important: The envelope that displays on the status bar only indicates that mail is waiting to be processed. It does not mean that you have new mail waiting on the server. When your mail is processed, user inactivity time is needed for your mail to be filtered and attachments decoded. Your inactivity allows you to decide when you want your mail processed.</i></p>

<p>If you click on the envelope, the mail is processed. If you right-click the envelope, a drop-down menu appears. Choose <b>Process All Waiting Tasks</b> to process and deliver all your mail, that is, mail sent or retrieved in the background.  Choose <b>Show Task Status</b> to display the Task Status showing background activity.</p>

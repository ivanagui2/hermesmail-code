<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>In an open window, go to step 1.</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Special </B>menu, choose <B>Make Address Book Entry</B>. The Make Address Book Entry dialog box appears. </P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>If you choose multiple message summaries in the mailbox window, addresses are taken from each message and all are put in the new entry.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>If the open or selected message is an outgoing message, the new entry will include all of the addresses in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>If the open or selected message is an incoming message, the new entry will include the address in the<I> </I>From: field.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>If you have more than one address book, in the<B> In the Address Book</B> drop-down list, choose the address book in which you want to place this nickname. You cannot make a new address book using the <I>Make Address Book Entry</I> command.</P>

<P>Also, when you use the <I>Make Address Book Entry </I>command in an open message or mailbox window, Eudora uses your current Replying settings. If the <I>Reply to all By default</I> setting is turned on (or if it is not and you hold down the Ctrl key when selecting Make Address Book Entry), the new entry will include all of the recipients of the message plus the sender. However, if the <I>Include yourself </I>setting is turned off and the current message is an incoming message, your address is not included in the new entry.</P>

<P>If you have the <B>When I delete a message, move it to Trash </B>option turned off in the Incoming Mail options window (see <A HREF="eudo8rp3.htm">Incoming Mail Options Window</A>), all new messages are delivered to your IMAP server and are kept there until you actively delete them. </P>

<P>Also, whenever you retrieve a message either in part or in full from the IMAP server to your computer, a copy of the message is kept on the IMAP server until you actively delete it. </P>

<P>Therefore to delete an IMAP message, you must delete it from the IMAP server. To delete messages from the IMAP server, you must perform two steps. </P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Mark the message for deletion. </P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Remove all marked messages.</P>

<P>To mark a message for deletion, do the following:</P>

<P>1.Open the IMAP mailbox or folder containing the message.</P>

<P>2.Select or open the message.</P>

<P>3.From the <B>Message</B> menu, choose <B>Delete</B>. Or press the Delete key. <BR>
<BR>
To unmark a marked message so that it won’t be deleted from the IMAP server, select or open the message and from the <B>Message</B> menu, choose <B>UnDelete</B>. Or right-click to display the drop-down menu; then choose <B>UnDelete</B>.</P>

<P>4.To remove all messages from the IMAP server marked for deletion, from the <B>Message </B>menu, choose <B>Purge Messages</B>. The messages are completely removed both from the IMAP server and from your computer.</P>

<P>Once you remove marked messages using the "Purge Messages" command, these messages are completely gone and cannot be restored. Therefore, use this command with caution.</P>

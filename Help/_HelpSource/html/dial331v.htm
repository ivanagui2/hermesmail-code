<p><b><a name="hidr_nicknames"></a><a name="hidc_nickname_left_grow"></a><sup></sup>Address Book</b></p>

<p>The Address Book is where you keep information about individuals or groups that you correspond with. Each entry in the Address Book includes a nickname for a person or group, their full email addresses, a real name, any contact information, and any notes. You can also use the Address Book to put nicknames on the Recipient List, and to address a new message.</p>

<p>You can use the <b>View By</b> option to display the entries using any of the fields except the <b>Notes</b> field. For example, if you want to view the entries by nicknames, choose <b>View By Nickname</b>.</p>

<p>You can perform a search for any entry in your address book. Press Ctrl+Shift+F or from the <b>Edit</b> menu, choose <b>Text</b>, then <b>Find Text</b>. In the Find dialog, enter the nickname of the person you are searching for. That person’s file appears.</p>

<p>You can also start typing in the list of entries, and the appropriate entry will be selected when you enter enough unique characters to identify it.</p>

<p>To create a new entry or entries to be included in the address book, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools </b>menu, choose <b>Address Book</b>, or press Ctrl+L. Or, if the Address Book is an inactive window in an open tabbed window group, click its tab.</p>

<p>2.In the Address Book, choose which address book (if more than one is set up) in which you want this person’s information listed, for example "Family." </p>

<p>3.Either click <b>New</b> in the Address Book, or right-click anywhere in the entry list to display the drop-down list and choose <b>New</b>. A new entry appears in the address book column (left side). To add a new address book, click <b>New Book</b>.</p>

<p>4.In the <b>Nickname</b> field (right side of window), enter what you want to call this person or address book. </p>

<p>A nickname, sometimes called an alias, is an easily remembered, shorter substitute for the email address in the entry. Nicknames can be used in place of proper email addresses in the To, Cc, and Bcc header fields of outgoing messages. A nickname entered here should be the name you wish to type in a header field (To, Cc, Bcc) when composing an email message. For example, although your Dad's name is John Smith, you can enter "Dad" as the nickname. So when you address a message, you can just enter "Dad" in the header field.</p>

<p>You cannot use the actual email address as the nickname. It must be different.</p>

<p>5.If you want the nickname on your recipient list, check the <b>Recipient list </b>box. Once the person is on the recipient list, the name is bolded in the address book list. </p>

<p>6.To create the entry, click anywhere or press Enter. </p>

<p>7.Click the <b>Personal </b>tab. The Personal dialog appears.</p>

<p>8.In the <b>Full Name</b> field, type the real name or an informal name for the person. If there is just one address for the entry, this name and the address are included in the "To:" field for your recipient to see.</p>

<p>9.In the<b> First Name</b> and <b>Last Name</b> fields, type the first and last name of the person. You can interchange the first and last names by clicking <b>Swap</b>.</p>

<p>10.In the <b>This nickname will expand to the following addresses</b> text field, enter at least one complete email address for this person. If this person has more than one address, enter the additional addresses here if you want him or her to receive your messages at each address. </p>

<p>Make sure this field contains no other information except addresses and nicknames, or your messages will be addressed incorrectly.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you have no more than 2,000 nicknames per nickname file. If the files are too large, they may appear collapsed in the address book, but you can still use all the nicknames when addressing messages. If you have a large number of entries, you might want to consider using a Ph or LDAP server.</p>

<p>11.  You may continue adding Home, Work, Other, and Notes information by clicking on the appropriate tabs.</p>

<p>12.   To save your changes to the Address Book, from the <b>File</b> menu choose <b>Save</b>.</p>

<p><i>Note: To toggle from the left and right window panes, press <b>F6</b>.</i></p>

<p>To include a nickname in the <b>Recipient List</b>, do the following:</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Right-click the appropriate Address Book entry in the list and from the pop-up menu, choose <b>Add to Recipient List</b>. The nickname for the selected entry is included on the Quick Recipient List, and the entry is bolded in the Address Book list.</p>

<p>To remove a nickname from the Quick Recipient List, do the following:</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>Right-click the item in the Address Book list and from the pop-up menu, choose <b>Remove From Recipient</b>. The nickname for the selected entry is removed from the Quick Recipient List, and the entry is unbolded in the Address Book list.</p>

<p>If you change a nickname, the Quick Recipient List is updated as appropriate. </p>

<p><i>Note:You can add or remove multiple nicknames to or from the Quick Recipient List by selecting multiple entries before right-clicking. Hold down the Shift key to select multiple entries in sequence, or the Ctrl key to make non-consecutive selections.</i></p>

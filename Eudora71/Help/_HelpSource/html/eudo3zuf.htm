<h2><a name="replying_options_window"></a>Replying Options Window</h2>

<p>The Replying options determine how replies are created.</p>

<p>To display the Replying options window, do the following:</p>

<p>1. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, select <b>Options</b>.</p>

<p>2. Scroll and click <b>Replying</b>. The Replying options window appears.</p>

<p>Listed below are field descriptions for Replying:</p>

<p><b>Map Ctrl+R to "Reply to All" —</b>— If this is on, then when you hold down the Ctrl key and press R, a new message is created addressed to all of the recipients of the original message as well as the sender.</p>

<p><b>Copy original’s priority to reply —</b>— If this is on, your replies use the same priority as the original message.</p>

<p><b>Automatically Fcc to original mailbox —</b>— If this is on, replies are automatically copied to the same mailbox that contains the original message<b> </b>with the exception of the In box, whose replies are copied to the Out box.</p>

<p><b>Include signature on reply </b>— If this is selected, your default signature will be included on all of your replies automatically.</p>

<p><b>Quote only the selected text</b>—If this is selected, only the text you highlight in a received message will appear on the reply message.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>When replying to all —</b>— This specifies how to address a reply. If <i>Include yourself </i>is on, when you <i>Reply to all</i> (as described above) your address is left in the address list of the new message and you receive a copy of your own reply. If this option is off (the default), your address is removed from the reply message and you do not receive a copy of the reply. </p>

<p>To determine who you are for the <i>Include yourself</i> option, Eudora uses the "me" nickname. You create the "me" nickname in your Address Book. If you do not have a "me" nickname, Eudora uses the contents of the  Login Name, Mail Server, and Return Address from the Getting Started options. </p>

<p>If <i>Put original To: recipients in Cc:</i> field is on (the default is off), the addresses of the original message recipients are moved from the <i>To</i> field to the <i>Cc</i> field of the reply-to-all message. Only the address of the original sender is placed in the To field. If this option is off, all of the addresses are placed in the <i>To</i> field of the reply message.</p>

<P>You can request that your recipients notify you when they have seen your message. To do this, click the Return Receipt button in the message toolbar.</P>

<P>When your recipients open the message and then close it, a dialog box appears asking them to create a notification message now, later, or never (if you send yourself a copy of the message, you will see the notification request). If a recipient chooses to create a notification message, it is sent to you and tells you when the recipient displayed your message.</P>

<P>If you receive a request for notification, click <B>Now</B> to queue the notification message in your Out mailbox: it will be sent the next time queued messages are sent. Click <B>Later</B> to close the message without sending a notification or click <B>Cancel</B> to dismiss the notification request from the screen while the return receipt message is open; however, each time you open the message and then close it (or if you try to delete it), the notification request will appear until you click either <B>Now</B> or <B>Never</B>. Click <B>Never</B> to cancel the notification request without ever sending a notification message.</P>

<P>The Return Receipt options may work differently than described, depending on your recipients’ email software.</P>

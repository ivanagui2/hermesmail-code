<H2><A NAME="docked_windows"></A>Docked Windows</H2>

<P>A window is said to be <I>dockable</I> if it is capable of being attached to one of the four edges of the main Eudora window. A window is said to be in the <I>docked</I> state if it is currently attached to one such edge.</P>

<P><I>Note:Some application programs identify the docking feature by words such as "gravity," "snap," "glue," "sticky," "join," and the like.</I></P>

<P>Only tool windows as described in <A HREF="eudo1pv7.htm">Window States and Tabbed Windows</A> , whether alone or tabbed, are dockable. All other windows in Eudora, particularly message windows and mailbox windows, are <I>not</I> dockable.</P>

<P><I>Note:The main toolbar, although not a window, is also dockable, to any edge of the main Eudora window or to another dockable window.</I></P>

<P>Dockable windows can be docked to any edge of the main Eudora window and to each other. You can also dock multiple windows along a single edge of the main window.</P>

<P>When you dock a window to the main window, the visible window work area is reduced. Docked windows cannot be obscured by normal windows, but they can be obscured by floating windows.</P>

<P>To make a window dockable, do the following:</P>

<P>1. Right-click the window’s border or tab and make sure the <B>Float In Main Window</B> command is unchecked (off) on the context menu (right-click).</P>

<P>2. Select (check) the <B>Allow Docking</B> command on the menu.</P>

<P>3. To dock the window, drag the window to an edge of the main Eudora window or to another docked window, and when the ghosted docking rectangle appears indicating that the window will be docked, release the mouse button. The window attaches to the main window edge or the other window.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> If you want to move a docked window to another location, right-click in the docked window to display the context menu (right-click).  Uncheck <B>Allow Docking</B> and check <B>Float in Main Window</B>. After the window changes shape, right-click again and check Allow Docking. Move the window to where you want it. </P>

<P>Some windows are more convenient to use when docked vertically (tall and skinny), while others are more convenient to use when docked horizontally (short and wide). Examples of windows that work better as tall-and-skinny windows are the Mailboxes window and the File Browser window. Examples of windows that work better as short-and-wide windows are the Personalities window and the Filter Report window.</P>

<P>Following are descriptions of the controls in docked windows. </P>

<P><B>The Gripper Bar</B></P>

<P>The <I>gripper bar</I>, also called the <I>grab handle</I>, is the double line at one edge of the docked window. Drag the window by the gripper bar to undock it from the main window frame. The window now floats; you can leave it as a floating window, or you can dock it to any edge of the main window or to another docked window. </P>

<P><I>Note:The toolbar has a gripper bar.</I></P>

<P><B>The Zoom Bar</B></P>

<P>When two or more windows are docked on the same edge of the main window, Eudora activates each window’s <I>zoom button</I>. This button appears next to the "x" close button and contains a small triangle. Click the zoom button to minimize, maximize, or restore the width or height of that docked window relative to the other docked windows adjacent to it. </P>

<P><B>The Close Button</B></P>

<P>The close button contains an "x" and appears next to the zoom button. Click the close button to close the docked window. </P>

<P><B>The Resize Bar</B></P>

<P>When two windows are docked side by side along one edge of the main window, a bar appears between them, called the <I>resize bar</I>. Drag this bar up or down, or to the left or right, as appropriate, to enlarge one of the docked windows and reduce the other. </P>

<P>Stationery files are templates for outgoing messages. If you find yourself repeatedly sending the same message, save the message as a stationery file and send it whenever you need to with the New Message With or Reply With commands. This way you don’t have to copy and paste text into a message; you can just open a pre-written message and edit it as necessary.</P>

<P>The Stationery window displays a single-column list of your stationery files.</P>

<P><I>Note:You can select only one item at a time in the list; you cannot select multiple items.</I></P>

<P>If you right-click a stationery item in the list, a context menu appears with the following commands (the standard Eudora window-management commands appear at the bottom):</P>

<P>•<B>New</B> — Create a new piece of stationery (a new stationery file). An untitled stationery window opens; enter the stationery name and from the File menu, choose <B>Save As Stationery</B>.</P>

<P>•<B>Edit</B> — Open an editing window for the selected stationery item. Make your changes and from the File menu, choose <B>Save As Stationery</B>, or close without saving to discard your changes.</P>

<P>•<B>Delete</B> — Delete the selected stationery item. Eudora asks you to confirm the deletion. Use the <B>Del</B> key (<B>Delete</B>) as a shortcut for this command.</P>

<P>•<B>Rename</B> — Rename the selected stationery file. Use the <B>F2</B> key as a shortcut for this command, or click the stationery file’s name box, then edit the name right in the box.</P>

<P>•<B>New Message With</B> — Create a new message with the selected stationery. As a shortcut for this command, either select the stationery item and press <B>Enter</B>, or just double-click the stationery item.</P>

<P>•<B>Reply With</B> — Reply with the selected stationery to the sender(s) of the received messages that are currently selected.</P>

<P>•<B>Reply to All With</B> — Reply with the selected stationery to the sender(s) and all recipients of the received messages that are currently selected.</P>

<P>You can also display the context menu and create new stationery by right-clicking anywhere in an empty Stationery window or by right-clicking anywhere <I>off</I> a stationery item in a non-empty Stationery window. </P>

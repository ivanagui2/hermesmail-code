<P>Sometimes it is convenient to save an outgoing message either as a safeguard when typing long messages or so you can return to it later to make changes.</P>

<P>To save the current message, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>File</B> menu, choose <B>Save</B>. Saved messages are put in the Out mailbox, and if at least one recipient is entered in either the <B>To</B> or the <B>Bcc</B> field, the saved message is shown with a bullet (•) in the Status column. If both the <B>To</B> and the <B>Bcc</B> fields are empty, the Status column is blank. The bullet indicates that the message not only has been saved, but is also ready to be sent or queued.</P>

<P>You can continue making changes to the message or close it. If you try to close an outgoing message window without saving that version of the message, an alert appears asking if the message should be saved or the changes discarded. If you select Discard and the message has never been saved, the message is deleted. </P>

<h2><a name="the_make_address_book_entry_command"></a>Make Address Book Entry Command</h2>

<p>The <b>Make Address Book Entry</b> command is used to create entries in your Address Book, and is especially helpful for making group entries.</p>

<p><font face="Symbol">·</font>In an open window, go to step 1.</p>

<p><font face="Symbol">·</font>In an open mailbox window, first select the message summary or summaries you want in the address book, then go to step 1.</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Special </b>menu, choose <b>Make Address Book Entry</b>. The Make Address Book Entry dialog box appears. </p>

<p>2.In the <b>Nickname</b> text box, Eudora enters the name in the email address or the message. You can change it if you like.</p>

<p>3.In the <b>Full Name</b> field, Eudora enters the full name as it appears in the email address of the message. You can change it if you like.</p>

<p>4.In the <b>First Name</b> and <b>Last Name</b> fields, Eudora enters the first and last name of the person as it appears in the email address or the message. You can change it if you like.</p>

<p>5.In the <b>This nickname will expand to the following address </b>field, Eudora enters the email address as it appears in the message. You can change the email address if you like.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If you choose multiple message summaries in the mailbox window, addresses are taken from each message and all are put in the new entry.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If the open or selected message is an outgoing message, the new entry will include all of the addresses in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If the open or selected message is an incoming message, the new entry will include the address in the<i> </i>From: field.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If you have more than one address book, in the<b> In the Address Book</b> drop-down list, choose the address book in which you want to place this nickname. You cannot make a new address book using the <i>Make Address Book Entry</i> command.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">§</font>If you want to put the nickname on your Recipient List, check the<b> Put it on the recipient list </b>box.</p>

<p>6.     When finished, click <b>OK</b>. The new entry is now in your address book.</p>

<p>If your new nickname has the same name as an existing nickname, a prompt appears asking if you want to add the address(es) to the existing nickname or replace the existing nickname with the new address(es).</p>

<p>Also, when you use the <i>Make Address Book Entry </i>command in an open message or mailbox window, Eudora uses your current Replying settings. If the <i>Reply to all By default</i> setting is turned on (or if it is not and you hold down the Ctrl key when selecting Make Address Book Entry), the new entry will include all of the recipients of the message plus the sender. However, if the <i>Include yourself </i>setting is turned off and the current message is an incoming message, your address is not included in the new entry.</p>

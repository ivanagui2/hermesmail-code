<P>In the User dialog box in the Groups window, you can maintain your group members by deleting them from the group, inviting new members, or by syncing the selected member’s shared folder.</P>

<P>To maintain group members, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>ESP</B> <B>Groups</B>. The ESP Groups window appears.</P>

<P>2.In the left column, choose the group whose users you wish to maintain.</P>

<P>3.Choose the <B>Users</B> tab. The Users dialog box appears, and a list of members of the selected group appears.</P>

<P>4.In this dialog box, you can do all of the following:</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Invite—</B>To invite a new ESP member to join the group, click <B>Invite</B>. See <A HREF="eudo6kvk.htm">Inviting Members to Join Your Group</A><U>.</U></P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Delete—</B>To delete group members, choose the member’s name and click <B>Delete</B>. You should use this function to delete invalid members. To preserve group participation and communication, use the <B>Delete</B> function sparingly. In most situations, the departing group member uses the <B>Leave</B> function to notify all group members of the departure from the group. The <B>Delete</B> function bypasses this process.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT><B>Sync Folder—</B> To send the entire contents of your shared folder to another group member, choose the member’s name and click <B>Sync Folder</B>.   </P>

<P><I>Note. ESP updates email addresses when you change the email address for a personality. When saved in the ESP Group window, ESP asks you if you want to update both your ESP's information and other members' information or just update your ESP information. If you choose both, an email message is sent to all group members and automatically updates your changed email address.</I></P>

<p>The location of your mailboxes and mail folders depends on whether your incoming mail server for your account uses the POP or IMAP protocol.</p>

<p>If your incoming mail server uses POP, then all of your mailboxes and mail folders are created and stored on your computer. If your incoming mail server uses IMAP, then all of your mailboxes and mail folders are created and stored on the IMAP server.</p>

<p>The parallel situation holds true if you have multiple email accounts: mailboxes and folders for <i>all</i> of your POP accounts are stored on your computer; mailboxes and folders for <i>all</i> of your IMAP accounts are stored on the respective IMAP servers.</p>

<p>You create an IMAP server account using the New Account Setup wizard for your dominant personality (see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-0001A8">Configuring Eudora</a> ), or using the Account Settings dialog, accessed from the Personalities window, for an alternate personality (see<a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-00015C"> Personalities Window</a> and <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=Eudora-B01B840A-0000D0">Account Settings Dialog</a> ).</p>

<p>The Mailboxes window is the main tool for managing your IMAP mailboxes and mail folders. In the Mailboxes window, right-click the folders or mailboxes in an IMAP hierarchy and select an item from the drop-down menu. (The additional commands for IMAP are <b>Refresh Mailbox List</b> and <b>Resynchronize Mailbox</b>.)</p>

<p>Mail folders stored on an IMAP server can contain not only mailboxes but also messages. Mail folders stored on a POP server can only contain mailboxes, not messages.</p>

<p>Some mailboxes stored on your IMAP server may have been created by others and made accessible to you. For some of these mailboxes you may have both "read and write" permission; that is, you cannot only read the messages stored in them but also change or delete the messages. Other mailboxes may give you only "read" permission: you can only read the messages, not change or delete them.</p>

<p>If you have multiple email accounts and the incoming mail servers for all of them use POP, then you will have only one top-level mail folder, named <b>Eudora</b> by default. If the incoming mail server for at least one of your personalities uses IMAP, then you can have multiple top-level mail folders: one to hold mail from <i>all</i> of your POP accounts, and one top-level folder for each of your IMAP accounts. The name of a top-level IMAP folder is the personality name for that IMAP account.</p>

<p>You can set up a group as an address book entry by adding the group’s email addresses or nicknames (if already set up in your address book) in the Personal dialog box.</p>

<p>To create a new group in an address book, do the following:</p>

<p>1.From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Address Book</b>, or press Ctrl + L. Or, if the Address Book is in an inactive window in an open tabbed window group, click its tab.</p>

<p>2.In the <b>Address Book</b>, choose which address book (if more than one is set up) in which you want this group's information listed. Click <b>New</b>.</p>

<p>3.Type the nickname in the <b>Nickname</b> text field on the right side of the window, for example "My buddies." The nickname entry appears in the list, and you can now add information for this entry.</p>

<p>4.When finished, click anywhere or press Enter and the nickname appears in the list.</p>

<p>5.Click the <b>Personal </b>tab. The Personal dialog box appears. In the <b>Full Name</b> field, type the a descriptive or an informal name for the group. This name is included in the "To" field for your recipient to see.</p>

<p>6.In the <b>This nickname will expand to the following addresses</b> text field, type the complete email address for each person included in the group. Separate multiple addresses with commas or carriage returns (this is the only place you can use a carriage return to separate addresses). You can also use nicknames in this field, but be sure that any nicknames you use are defined by their own entry. You can use a mixture of nicknames and complete email addresses.</p>

<p>Make sure this field contains no other information except addresses and nicknames, or your messages will be addressed incorrectly.</p>

<p>7.If you want to put this group on your recipient list, check the <b>Recipient List</b> box. The group’s name is bolded in the address book list.</p>

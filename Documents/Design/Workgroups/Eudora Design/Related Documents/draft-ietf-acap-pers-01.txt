1.  Abstract
    
    It has become common for Internet mail users to receive and compose
    mail in the capacity of different roles or identities (for example,
    personal and work), to receive and compose mail at different
    machines, and to use multiple programs which require mail
    composition configuration information.  These different roles or
    identities have become known as email personalities.
    
    The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an
    ideal mechanism for storage of email personality data.
    
    This specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class for email
    personalities, and a common option for indicating a default.
    
    
2.  Conventions Used in this Document
    
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
    in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
    use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].
    
    
3.  ACAP Standard Options
    
    This specification defines the MUA Default Personality standard
    option.  This is a scaler option in the ACAP Standard Option
    ("/option") dataset.  The entry name is "mua.default.personality".
    The "option.value" attribute contains the value, which is a URL.
    Generally, this will be an ACAP URL pointing to an entry in an Email
    Personality dataset.
    




Gellens                   Expires xxxxxx 1998                   [Page 2]Internet Draft      ACAP Email Personality Dataset Class      xxxx 1998

    The standard option dataset class is specified in [ACAP-OPTIONS].
    ACAP URLs are defined in [ACAP].
    
    
4.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Class
    
    The ACAP Email Personality dataset class defines a set of attributes
    which specify an email personality; that is, configuration
    information used for composing email.
    
    
4.1.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Class Prefix
    
    Datasets whose names begin with "/personality" are assumed to
    contain email personality entries as defined in this specification.
    
    
4.2.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Hierarchy
    
    Each user may have a set of named email personalities.  The default
    is pointed at by the "mua.default.personality" standard option.
    (See section 3 for more information.)
    
    Inheritance is likely to be useful both for inheriting site or group
    defaults (for example, SMTP servers, and initial client
    configuration in general) as well as for inheriting user-specific
    configuration when using different machines.
    
    
5.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Attributes
    
    An email personality entry MUST have an "entry" attribute.  All
    other attributes are OPTIONAL.
    
    Attributes are specified using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF].
    All attributes are single-valued and textual unless otherwise
    stated.
    
    The ABNF defines the content of the attribute values prior to their
    encoding as an ACAP string.  Clients MUST conform to the syntax when
    generating these attributes, but MUST NOT assume that the attribute
    values will conform to this syntax on access.  Servers MUST NOT
    enforce the syntax.
    
    
5.1.  Basic Attributes
    
    These attributes are defined in ACAP [ACAP] and have meaning in all
    dataset classes.  The section describes how they are used in an
    email personality dataset.

    entry
        The "entry" attribute is used to hold a unique name for the
        personality.  This name is used for inheritance, so when
        customizing a personality which has an entry in an inherited
        dataset, the entry name needs to remain the same.  The name
        should also be descriptive.
        
    subdataset
        The "subdataset" attribute indicates there is another email
        personality dataset underneath this entry.
    
    
5.2.  Specific Attributes
    
    These attributes are specific to the Email Personality dataset
    class.

    personality.Auto.Sign
        This flag indicates if the client should automatically apply a
        digital signature to messages composed with this personality.

        pers-charset        = 1*CHAR
        
    personality.File-Into.IMAP
        This specifies an IMAP folder into which new messages should be
        copied.  Generally, this is specified as an IMAP URL, as defined
        in [URL-IMAP].
        
        pers-file-imap      = url ;defined in [URL-BASIC]

    personality.Header.Extra
        This multivalued attribute contains additional header fields.
        Each value contains the complete canonical form of a header name
        and contents.  Values must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME].
        
        pers-hdr-extra      = 1*CHAR
                              ;must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME]
        
    personality.Header.Reply-To

        Values must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME].
        
        pers-hdr-reply      = 1*CHAR
                              ;must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME]
        
    personality.Language
        This contains the default language to be specified in language
        tags.  The name must be in the IANA language registry (located
        at <ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/languages>).
        
        pers-lang           = 1*CHAR
        
    personality.MIME.Composition-Type
        This specifies the default MIME type to use when composing
        messages which contain any text elements or parts.  The value is
        a MIME type and subtype, with optional parameters.  The value
        should be canonicalized by removing unnecessary quoting.  The
        type, subtype, and any parameters must conform to [MIME],
        including IANA registration requirements.  Free insertion of
        linear-white-space is not permitted.
        
        pers-mtype          = type "/" subtype *(";" SP parameter)
                              ;defined in RFC 2045 [MIME]

    personality.PGP.Key-ID.bin
        This contains the Key ID when PGP is used to encrypt and/or sign
        messages.
        
        pers-pgp-key        = *OCTET
        
    personality.Real-Name
        This contains the display name associated with the personality.
        The phrase component of the From header field should be
        constructed from this value.
        
        pers-name           = 1*UTF8-CHAR
        
    personality.Return-Address
        This contains the [RFC-822] addr-spec associated with the
        personality.  The addr-spec of the From header field should by
        default contain this value.  It is separated from the phrase
        From field component (stored in "personality.Real-Name") to make
        comparisons easier.
        
        pers-addr           = addr-spec

        pers-smtp           = url ;defined in [URL-BASIC]
        
    personality.Signature.Text
        This contains the signature text to be appended by default to
        new messages.  It is stored in canonical form, with
        CRLF-separated lines.  When a signature separator line is used,
        it SHOULD NOT be contained in this attribute, but instead added
        automatically by the client.
        
        pers-sig-text       = 1*CHAR
        
    personality.Signature.URL
        When the signature to be appended by default to new messages is
        stored in a file or other resource, this attribute is used
        instead of "personality.Signature.Text".  This attribute
        contains a URL (for example, a file URL) to the signature text.
        It is assumed that the signature text is in canonical form, with
        CRLF-separated lines.  When a signature separator line is used,
        it SHOULD NOT be contained in this file, but instead added
        automatically by the client.
        
        pers-sig-url        = url ;defined in [URL-BASIC]

    personality.Stationery
        This attribute contains a URL (for example, a file URL) to the
        stationery, or template, to be used when creating new messages
        with this personality.  In general the stationery contains a
        canonicalized message, with header fields and/or body.

8.  Security Considerations
    
    As with ACAP datasets in general, it is important that access
    controls are set correctly on Email Personality datasets.
    Attributes may contain highly personal information which should not
    be disclosed except by explicit owner request.

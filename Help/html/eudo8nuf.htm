<P>The Miscellaneous options determine additional Eudora capabilities that are not categorized with other functions.</P>

<P>To display the Miscellaneous options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Miscellaneous</B>. The Miscellaneous options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are the field descriptions for Miscellaneous:</P>

<P><B>Switch messages with:</B></P>

<P><B>Unmodified arrow keys</B> —— If this is on and there is an incoming message window open on the screen, the up or left arrow key closes the current message and opens the previous message in the mailbox, and the down or right arrow key closes the current message and opens the next message in the mailbox. If this is on and the Show message preview pane option is on in the <A HREF="eudo6szb.htm">Viewing Mail options</A> , and keyboard focus is currently in the preview pane of an open mailbox window, then pressing the unmodified arrow keys changes the view in the preview pane going up or down the message summary list, as appropriate. If the Unmodified arrow keys option is turned off, the arrow keys can be used to move the cursor (insertion point) in messages and the preview pane.</P>

<P><I>Note:Even if Unmodified arrow keys is on, the arrow keys do not switch messages if there is an outgoing <BR>
message topmost on the screen.</I></P>

<P><B>Ctrl+arrow keys</B> —— If this is on, you can switch messages by holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the arrow keys. The switching behavior is as described above under the Unmodified arrow keys option. The Ctrl+arrow keystrokes do not work when composition windows are open on the screen.</P>

<P><B>Alt+arrow keys</B> —— If this is on, you can switch messages by holding down the Alt key and pressing the arrow keys. The switching behavior is as described above under the Unmodified arrow keys option. The Alt+arrow keystrokes do work when composition windows are open on the screen.</P>

<P><B>Empty Trash when exiting</B> —— If this is on, the Trash mailbox is emptied when you exit Eudora. If this is off, the Trash is only emptied when you select Empty Trash from the Special menu.</P>

<P><B>Say OK to alerts after _ second(s)</B> [default: 120] —— If this is on, any alerts that announce a problem with the network communication automatically go away after the specified number of seconds. Many network problems are temporary, so this allows Eudora to try the communication again. This is most useful if you have automatic mail-checking enabled for any of your accounts.</P>

<P><B>Turbo redirect by default</B> —— If this is on and you select Redirect To, a redirected message is created with the specified recipient, the message is queued, and the original message is deleted.</P>

<P><B>Include outdated ‘Return-Receipt-To’</B> —— If this is off, Eudora uses the "Disposition-Notification-To:" header in return receipt requests to request that you be sent a notification when your message appears by the recipient. If this is on, Eudora also sends the "Return-Receipt-To:" header in return receipt requests. This header is understood by some older mail delivery systems, and may return you a receipt when your message is delivered to your recipient’s mailbox. The "Return-Receipt-To:" header cannot give you any information about whether or not your recipient displayed your mail, and is not supported by many newer mail delivery systems.</P>

<P><B>Automatically expand nicknames</B> —— If this is on, nicknames in message headers are replaced with the real addresses when you switch fields.</P>

<P><B>Auto-save messages every _ minutes</B>—Enter the number of minutes between auto-save intervals. In case of a system shut-down, the messages saved are from the most current auto-save.</P>

# These are the settings for SpamHeaders
# Lines starting with a '#' are ignored
# Each line defines a spam filter
#	A filter scores a header, and gives a score between 0 and 100, with 0
#		meaning "Not Spam", and 100 meaning "Spam"
#
# A filter consists of 5 parts:
#	A pattern to match the entire header against
#	Score - this is only used in the case of "kTextTag" - if the text matches use this score.
#	Offset - offset the score from this value.
#	Scale - Scale the value by this value.	
#	A description of what the sub-patterns are. This takes one of four types:
#		kTextIntMatch - value is an integer
#		kTextFloatMatch - value is a floating point number
#		kTextTag - value is a string literal
#		kCharacterCount - value's length is the important thing
#
#	For example, Postini gives you a score that is between 0 .. 100, with low scores being spam.
#		We give them a scale of -1, and an offset of 100; between them, this scales the scores into
#			the range that we want. 

# PerlMX - no scaling, since the scores are already 0 .. 100
"X-PerlMx-Spam:.*Probability=([0-9]+).*" 0 0 1 kTextIntMatch

# Pure Message - no scaling, since the scores are already 0 .. 100
"X-Puremessage-Spam:.*Probability=([0-9]+).*" 0 0 1 kTextIntMatch

# Spam Assassin (both forms)
# The actual score is 0 .. 10, so we scale by a factor of 10
"X-Spam-Score:.*\((\*+)\).*" 0 0 10 kCharacterCount

"X-Spam-Level:.*Level (\*+).*" 0 0 10 kCharacterCount

# If the text matches, we give it a score of 99
"X-Spam-Flag: YES.*" 99 0 1 kTextTag
"X-Razor-Warning: SPAM.*" 99 0 1 kTextTag
"X-PM-Status: JUNK.*" 99 0 1 kTextTag
"X-MsgFire-Status: JUNK.*" 99 0 1 kTextTag
"X-DSPAM-Result: Spam.*" 99 0 1 kTextTag

# Postini - several differenct scores; we picke the one that gives us the highest score.
"X-pstn-levels: +\(C:([0-9\.]+) M:([0-9\.]+) P:([0-9\.]+) R:([0-9\.]+) +S:([0-9\.]+) \).*" 0 100 -1 kTextFloatMatch

# UC Irvine uses a modified SpamAssassin
"X-UCIRVINE-SpamCheck:.*score=([0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?).*" 0 0 1 kTextFloatMatch

# Brown 
"X-Brown-MailScanner-SpamScore:.*(s+).*" 0 0 10 kCharacterCount

"X-NACS_ES-MailScanner-SpamScore:.*(s+).*" 0 0 10 kCharacterCount

SOLUTION: WE HAVE A STATIC VARIABLE IN THE VIEW CLASS WITH THE CURRENT VIEW. THE SOLUTION IS TO CYCLE THROUGH ALL THE VIEWS AND GET THE DOCUMENT FROM THERE!!!!!!!!

02/08/19 : 19:50:
	Some of this have now been implemented but a general cleanup is still needed.

Find out when all components of Doc/View architecture has been created.
Update MailDetailView from all lines of attack

[Move CMailDetailView::Reset() into CMailDetailView::UpdateData(FALSE) section. They´re alway called together.] DONE @ 02/08/19 : 19:50:

Noticable is perhaps that the font is not really part of the option/properties. We need to make sure CComVariant can store a structure of arbitrary size.
Really really need to find out how to store the LOGFONT structure in the CComVariant (SAFEARRAY?, LPVOID of some kind?). Also how to enforce the font in the CRichEditView.

Implement all of:
	AssertValid
	Dump

<P>When Eudora does a mail check, you can be notified of new mail in one or all of the following ways: </P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Alert dialog box</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Mailbox receiving new mail opens</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT> "New Mail" sound. </P>

<P>These options are turned on or off in the <A HREF="eudo8b3r.htm">Getting Attention</A> window. To display the Getting Attention window, open the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Options</B>. Scroll through the icons and select <B>Getting Attention</B>.</P>

<P>When you receive notice that new mail has arrived, select Eudora from the Windows task bar. Mail usually arrives in the In mailbox unless you are using filters to transfer messages. If the In mailbox is not already open, from the <B>Mailbox</B> menu, choose <B>In</B>. The messages are listed in the order that they are received, with the most recent message listed last. Unread messages are designated by a bullet in the Status column of the message summary.</P>

<P>Double-click a message summary to open the message. You can also view messages using the message preview window at the bottom of the mailbox window while the message summary is highlighted.</P>

<P>Incoming messages are saved indefinitely in the In mailbox (or the mailbox they are filtered into) until they are deleted or transferred to another mailbox.</P>

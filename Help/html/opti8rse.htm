<P>The Automation options let you control and exchange information with Eudora from other programs that support the Windows Automation Interface, such as Microsoft Visual Basic.</P>

<P>Automation gives you external access to Eudora mail folders, mailboxes, and messages, and to the Eudora application itself. With automation enabled, you can create, delete, and move Eudora mail folders, mailboxes, and messages, as well as get notification of these three operations when they are performed manually. You can also get lists of the subfolders under folders and of the messages within mailboxes.</P>

<P>For more information on the automation feature, visit the Web site www.eudora.com, where you can find up-to-date automation SDKs (Software Developer’s Kits) and documentation.</P>

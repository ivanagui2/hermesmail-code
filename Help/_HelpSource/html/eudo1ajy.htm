<p>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)</p>

<p>Similar to the "Finish Address Book Entry" command, Auto-Completion allows you to enter a portion of a name in the <b>To</b>, <b>Cc</b>, and <b>Bcc</b> fields, and HERMES automatically completes the name for you. Just start typing and HERMES attempts to complete the name. If multiple recipients match the text you’ve entered, a list of names from your history file and address book appear in a drop-down name list (provided both the history file and address book are selected in the new Auto-Completion option window explained later in this section). Select the correct name, and the name and email address appear in the field. </p>

<p>The history file consists of names and email addresses of people you have previously sent, forwarded, or replied to messages within HERMES. </p>

<p>The address book consists of the nicknames you have entered for each person in your address book. </p>

<p>For example, you may want to send Barbara a message. Previously, you had to enter her nickname from your address book, or if she wasn’t in your address book, her full email address. By using the auto-completion feature, just enter B in the To field, and HERMES displays a drop-down name list with names beginning with "B" for you to choose from (you can also press [Esc] to prevent the drop-down name list from appearing). If you had typed BA, HERMES would have displayed a drop-down name list with all names beginning with "Ba." Scroll through the name list, click or press Enter to select the correct name. The name is now entered into the header field. </p>

<p>If you have only a "Barbara" and a "Beth" as names in your address book or history file, HERMES completes the first alphabetical name. So when you type B, "Barbara" would appear first on the list (if <b>Names should appear in alphabetical order</b> is selected in the Auto Completion options window explained later in this section).</p>

<p>The address book icon (open book with tabs) indicates that the name came from your address book, and the history file icon (page with corner bent) indicates that the name came from your history file. If the name is from your history file, both the username and email address appear in the drop-down name list as you type. If the name is from your address book, only the nickname appears in the drop-down name list.</p>

<p>To complete the name in the field, select the correct name from the drop-down list. If you want to add another name in the To field, type a comma (,) after the first recipient’s name. Then you can begin to add another recipients name.</p>

<p>To delete a name from the auto-completion drop-down list, choose it and press the <b>Delete</b> key.</p>

<p>To turn the name auto-completion feature off, go to the Tools menu, choose Options, and then select Auto-completion. Deselect <b>Address Book </b>and <b>History File </b>and click<b> OK</b>.</p>

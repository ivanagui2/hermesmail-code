<P>In addition to the default directory service databases that already comes configured with Eudora, you can create new <B>Ph</B>, <B>Finger</B>, and <B>LDAP</B> databases for your Directory Services queries. By adding a new database, you can then query that database for names, email addresses, phone numbers, and so on. Databases are created from the Protocols section of the window, and they must be created using one of these three listed protocols.</P>

<P><I>Important:You must be able to identify the server by its description and its host name before you can add it to Directory Services.</I></P>

<P><I>Note:You cannot create a new database using the <B>Eudora Address Book</B> protocol in the list. Nickname files must be created from the Address Book window. See <A HREF="eudo9mi3.htm">Using the Address Book</A> for more details.</I></P>

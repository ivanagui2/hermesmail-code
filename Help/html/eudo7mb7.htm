<P>Eudora comes with two default tabbed windows that together include all eleven tool windows.</P>

<P>The first default is a vertically oriented tabbed window that is docked to the left side of the main window and contains the following five tool windows, with tabs in left-to-right order:</P>

<P>•Mailboxes Window</P>

<P>•File Browser Window</P>

<P>•Stationery Window</P>

<P>•Signatures Window</P>

<P>•Personalities Window</P>

<P>The second default  tabbed window is a normal window that contains these four tool windows, with tabs in left-to-right order (to display this window, display one of the member windows from the Tools menu):</P>

<P>•Directory Services Window</P>

<P>•Address Book</P>

<P>•Filters Window</P>

<P>•Filter Report Window</P>

<P>The third default tabbed window is a docked window that contains two tool windows, with tabs on the left side in top to bottom order. To display this window, display one of the member windows from the Tools menu.</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Task Status Window</P>

<P><font face="Symbol">·</FONT>Task Errors Window</P>

<P><I>Note:The far-left window is the default window that will display. To change this default window, select the window you want to display as the default, and drag it to the far-left tabbed window grouping. See <A HREF="eudo31o3.htm">Reorganizing Tabbed Windows</A> for more information.</I></P>

<P>You can reorganize these default tabbed windows any way you like. Your new organization will be preserved when you quit and restart Eudora.</P>

<P><I>Note:Due to file format incompatibilities, if you upgrade from a pre-4.0 version of Eudora you will lose the previous docking state of your Mailboxes window and toolbar. Eudora will reset the toolbar and docking states to the default configuration noted above. However, customized toolbar information is preserved; only the size and location of your toolbar may change.</I></P>

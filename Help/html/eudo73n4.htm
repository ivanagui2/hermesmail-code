<P>When you want to leave a group, ESP removes the group from your list of available groups and sends a message to the other group members asking them to remove you from the group.</P>

<P>To leave a group, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>ESP</B> <B>Groups</B>. The ESP Groups window appears.</P>

<P>2.In the left column, choose the name of the group you want to leave. </P>

<P>3.Click <B>Leave </B>(located at the bottom of the Groups window). The Leave Share Group dialog box opens.</P>

<P>4.In the Leave Group dialog box, click <B>Leave</B>. </P>

<P>ESP creates a message to other group members announcing your departure from the group. This message’s attachment deletes you from other group members’ membership lists. </P>

<P>Until you save changes to the ESP Groups window, you can cancel your departure from the group. Just choose the share group that you had planned to leave and click <B>Rejoin</B>, which is what the <I>Leave</I> button will be renamed when you chose this group. </P>

<P>If you're sure you want to leave the group, then save changes to the ESP Groups window by either closing the window and choosing <B>Save</B> in the displayed dialog box or by choosing <B>Save</B> from the File menu. ESP will send a message to other group members announcing your departure from the group.</P>

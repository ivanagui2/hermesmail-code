<H2><A NAME="changing_the_eudora_mode"></A>Changing the Eudora Mode</H2>

<P>You can <B><I>choose</I></B> one of three operating modes on how you wish to use Eudora. They are as follows:</P>

<P><B>Paid mode</B></P>

<P>This mode provides the full-featured Eudora desktop email client without advertising.</P>

<P><B>Sponsored mode</B></P>

<P>This mode provides the full-featured Eudora desktop email client at no charge, supported by sponsors' advertising. It includes all of the features that are in the Paid mode.</P>

<P><B>Light mode</B></P>

<P>This is an upgrade to the freeware version formerly known as Eudora Light. It includes fewer features than the other modes and a sponsor image or logo, but no advertising.</P>

<P>If you bought Eudora from a retail store or from a web site, Eudora installs in paid mode. However, if you would like to change the operating mode, for example to sponsored mode, you can do so right in the Eudora program. (Remember to request a refund from QUALCOMM. See the last page of this guide for details.)</P>

<P>To change the Eudora operating mode after you install Eudora, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Help</B> menu, choose <B>Payment &amp; Registration</B>. The Payment and Registration window appears.</P>

<P>2.In the <B>Which Eudora is right for you? </B>section: </P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>To use Eudora in sponsored mode, click <B>Sponsored Mode (free, with ads)</B>. Eudora displays the ad window. </P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>To use Eudora in paid mode, click <B>Paid Mode (costs money, no ads)</B>. Eudora displays the Eudora web site for you to purchase Eudora.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>To use Eudora in light mode, click <B>Light Mode (free, fewer features)</B>. Eudora changes to light mode by shutting down certain features. The features that will be off are listed in the Light mode dialog box.</P>

<P>3.In the <B>Keeping Current </B>section:</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>To customize the ads, click <B>Customize the Ads You See</B>. Eudora displays a web site where you can provide information about yourself to help in customizing which ads should be displayed to you.</P>

<P><font face="Wingdings">§</FONT>To find the most current version of Eudora, click <B>Find the Latest Versions</B>. The Eudora web site displays where you can retrieve the latest version of Eudora.</P>

<P>You can tell which mode you are in because that button is grayed out. </P>

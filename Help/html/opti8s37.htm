<P>This column lists the different timeframes displayed in the Statistics window. Current refers to the current day, week, month, or year, as selected in the Statistics window. Previous refers to the previous day, week, month, or year, as selected in the Statistics window. Average is the cumulative average that occurs on a day-to-day basis. For example, if you choose to view your statistics for each day, the current graph would be today, and the previous graph would be yesterday. The average graph would indicate the cumulative average since you began keeping statistical information in Eudora.</P>

<P>The Background Tasks allow you to set parameters that determine how background tasks behave, and what kind of information you want to see in the Task Status window. In other words, you can configure the behavior of background tasks. Also, you can set the Task Status and/or the Task Error windows to be brought to the front of other windows in Eudora when activity occurs. See <A HREF="eudo1fp4.htm">Task Status Window</A> and <A HREF="eudo7rg7.htm">Task Error Window</A>.</P>

<P>In the Background Tasks options window, you can indicate the number of seconds of user inactivity before your newly retrieved mail is actually processed by Eudora. If you have automatic mail checking set up in the Checking Mail options, Eudora will retrieve the mail in the background from the incoming server at those time intervals. But Eudora will not process it until there is no user activity performed on your computer for the amount of seconds you indicate in the Background Tasks options window. An envelope displayed on the status bar, located at the lower right-hand corner of the Eudora window, indicates that there is retrieved mail to be processed; that is, messages to be filtered and placed in mailboxes.</P>

<P><I><B>Technical Note.</B> In the background, Eudora retrieves and sends mail; in the foreground, Eudora processes attachments and applies filters.</I></P>

<P>To display the Background Tasks options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2.Scroll and click <B>Background Tasks</B>. The Background Tasks options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Background Tasks.</P>

<P><B>Task Status Columns</B>—These options determine which columns are displayed in the Task Status window. Check the box next to the field whose column you want to display. The options are Task, Persona, Status, Details, and Progress.</P>

<P><B>Task</B>—Displays an icon with a short description of the tasks’ actions.</P>

<P><B>Persona</B>—Available only if you have set up more than one personality. If checked, the Personality column displays the personality name for the given task.</P>

<P><B>Status</B>—Displays a general description of the tasks current status, for example, "Logging into POP server."</P>

<P><B>Details</B>—Displays more information of the tasks’ status including network protocol commands. </P>

<P><B>Progress</B>—Displays a progress bar indicating the overall progress of the tasks.</P>

<P><B>Wait for _ seconds of idle time before automatically delivering spooled messages</B>—[default: 20 seconds) If Eudora is retrieving mail automatically in the background, the amount of time set in this field indicates the idle time Eudora waits before delivering mail to your mailboxes and folders. For example, if you are composing a message and Eudora is retrieving mail in the background, Eudora will not deliver the mail until you stop typing for the amount of time indicated here. If you set the time for 5 seconds, Eudora delivers your mail if you stop typing for at least 5 seconds. This field is beneficial if you don’t want to be interrupted too frequently while using Eudora. If the number is large in this field, you’ll get fewer interruptions. </P>

<P><B>Bring error window to front</B>—Check this option to have the Task Error window brought to the front when an error occurs.</P>

<P><B>Bring task status window to front</B>—Check this option to have the Task Status window brought to the front when a task occurs, for example sending or receiving mail.</P>

<P>IMAP messages that have been marked for deletion still remain in the mailbox until the mailbox is purged or expunged, but may be hidden from view. This option allows you to decide whether those deleted messages should be displayed when they match a search criteria, or if the setting is turned off, filtered out of the search results.</P>

<P><B>Junk Threshold</B>—Eudora distinguishes junk mail by a scoring system. You can adjust this scoring threshold by using the slide bar indicator. If you slide the arrow to a lower number, Eudora filters out more junk mail but may also mistakenly filter more valid mail to the Junk mailbox. If you slide the arrow to a higher number, Eudora filters less junk mail but is less likely to incorrectly filter valid mail. The default setting is 50. </P>

<P><B>Mail isn't junk if the sender is in an address book</B>—Check this box to indicate that mail coming from people in your address book(s) should never be marked as junk mail. </P>

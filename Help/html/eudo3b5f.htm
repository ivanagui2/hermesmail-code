<P>To open a tabbed window that’s hidden, open any of its member windows by selecting the appropriate command from the <B>Tools</B> menu. The tabbed window opens with the selected window as the active (frontmost) window.</P>

<P>If the tabbed window is already visible, and you wish to display one of its member windows that is currently not active, simply click the member window’s tab. You can also select the appropriate item from the Tools menu. The desired window comes to the front of the tabbed group.</P>

<P>You can also use the tool window’s keyboard shortcut, if it has one, to open or activate the tool window in its tabbed window. </P>

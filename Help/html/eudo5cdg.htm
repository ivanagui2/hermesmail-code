<H2><A NAME="using_your_password"></A>Using Your Password</H2>

<P>Each time you open Eudora and check mail for the first time, you need to enter a password for each incoming mail account that you have. This password is required by the incoming mail server before it will transfer your mail, so that no one else can get your mail from the server.</P>

<P><I>Note:This does not protect your mail once it is on your computer. Unless a message has been sent with some type of security, it is plain text that many applications can read. If you are interested in securing the messages on your computer, you may want to consider a disk driver that can encrypt hard disk data.</I></P>

<P>If you need to enter a password, the Eudora Password dialog box appears. Enter your password and click <B>OK</B>. If you make a mistake before clicking OK, simply backspace and re-enter the password correctly.</P>

<P><I>Note:Your incoming mail account password is case sensitive, so the uppercase and lowercase characters must be typed in exactly. Be sure that Caps Lock is off.</I></P>

<P>If your password is rejected, an error message appears indicating that you have entered the wrong password. Choose <B>Check Mail</B> from the <B>File</B> menu to redisplay the password dialog box.</P>

<P>As long as Eudora is running, it remembers all of your passwords. If you don’t want it to remember (if, for example, you are away from your computer), choose <B>Forget Password(s)</B> from the <B>Special</B> menu. The next time you check mail for any account, you are prompted for your password again.</P>

<P><I>Note:   If you have more than one personality, a window appears listing the names of your personalities. You can select the personalities whose passwords you want Eudora to forget. All the personalities are selected by default. Deselect the personalities you don’t want Eudora to forget. </I></P>

<P>You can also make Eudora remember all of your passwords from one session to the next, which means you never have to enter passwords again, even if you quit and restart Eudora. You want to do this only if your computer is in a secure location where there is no possible chance of someone else is having access to it. To use this option, turn on <B>Save password</B> in the <A HREF="eudo8saf.htm">Checking Mail Options Window</A>.</P>

<P>The Viewing Mail options determine how Eudora displays incoming and outgoing message windows and the message preview pane in mailbox windows.</P>

<P>To display the Viewing Mail options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Viewing Mail</B>. The Viewing Mail options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Viewing Mail:</P>

<P><B>Message Window —</B>— These options determine how Eudora displays received and composition messages.</P>

<P><B>Use Microsoft’s viewer —</B>— If this is off, Eudora displays advanced formatting, graphics, and multimedia in incoming and outgoing messages, using its own built-in viewer. If this is on, Eudora takes full advantage of the Web browser capabilities of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 4.0 or later by showing Web content right in incoming and outgoing messages or linking to the Internet, without your having to open the Web browser. This option is only available if you have Microsoft’s Internet Explorer version 4.0 or higher installed and available on your system.</P>

<P><B>Message window width —</B>— This specifies the width of new and received message windows (in characters). This option has no effect on what your mail looks like when it is sent. When mail is sent, Eudora wraps at or before 76 columns.</P>

<P><I>Note:If you use a proportional font, Eudora sets the window width based on the average width of the characters in the font.</I></P>

<P><B>Message window height —</B>— This specifies the height of new and received message windows (in lines).</P>

<P><I>Note:If the "Zoom windows when opening" option is turned on, received message window heights are automatically adjusted to the height of the message text.</I></P>

<P><B>Preview Pane —</B>— These options determine the visibility and behavior of the message preview pane that appears at the bottom of mailbox windows. For more information, see <A HREF="eudo2x9h.htm">Message Preview Pane</A>.</P>

<P><B>Show message preview pane —</B><B>—</B><B> </B>If this option is on, Eudora displays the message preview pane in mailbox windows. The preview pane previews a single selected message. A splitter between the preview pane and the message summary list lets you resize the preview pane relative to the list.</P>

<P><B>Mark previewed messages as read after _ second(s)</B> —— If this option is on and the "Show message preview pane" option is turned on, the message currently selected in the mailbox window and previewed in the preview pane is automatically marked as read (blank in the Status column) after the specified number of seconds. If this option is off, a previewed message will not automatically be marked as read. Note: You can use the Shift+Space shortcut to convert a message back and forth between the Unread (•) and Read status.</P>

<P><B>Automatically open next message —</B>— If this is on, deleting or transferring the current message opens the next message in the mailbox, but only if that message is unread.</P>

<P><B>Zoom windows when opening —</B>— If this option is on, new message windows automatically open to their "zoomed" size. The zoomed size is computed on a window-by-window basis. For message windows, zoomed size is just long enough to display all of the message (but no longer than the main window), and as wide as the Message window width setting. Composition windows zoom to the height specified by the Message window height setting.</P>

<P><B>Allow executables in HTML content</B>—If this is selected, you are able to run programs such as Java<B>™</B> Applets, JavaScript<B>™</B>, VB Script<B>™</B>, and ActiveX<B>™</B> Controls that are embedded in an HTML texted message. For security reasons, you may want to leave this option deselected. </P>

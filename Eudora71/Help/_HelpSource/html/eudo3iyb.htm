<p>If you experience something you think might be a bug in Eudora, report it by sending a message to <br />
<u>win-eudora-bugs@qualcomm.com</u> or choose Report A Bug from the Help menu, Eudora displays a new composition window addressed to Windows Eudora Bugs at Qualcomm. If you are having technical problems with Eudora, just answer the questions in the email message.</p>

<p>You can describe what you did, what happened, what version of Eudora you have, any error messages Eudora gave (the numbers in parentheses ()'s are especially important), what kind of computer you have, which operating system you're using, and anything else you think might be relevant.</p>

<p>You will receive an automated response indicating that your bug report has been received and forwarded to our engineering staff. Unless additional information is needed, you will not receive a direct response.</p>

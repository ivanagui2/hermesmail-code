<P>You can manually check for new mail at any time by selecting <B>Check Mail</B> from the <B>File</B> menu. Any account that has the <B>Check Mail</B> option turned on (in the Account Settings dialog accessed from the Personalities window) is checked. If you haven’t successfully entered your password since opening the Eudora program, you are prompted for it for each account being checked. A progress window is momentarily displayed at the top of the screen indicating that an attempt to reach your incoming mail account is being made. </P>

<h2><a name="floating_windows"></a>Floating Windows</h2>

<p>A window is said to be in the <i>floating</i> state if it floats above the main HERMES window and can be placed anywhere on the desktop, including outside the main HERMES window. In this way a floating window is a standard Windows "Always on Top" window, like tool palettes in paint programs.</p>

<p>Only tool windows as described in <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-0000E0">Window States and Tabbed Windows</a>, whether alone or tabbed, can be made to float. All other windows in HERMES, particularly message windows and mailbox windows, <i>cannot</i> be made to float.</p>

<p>All windows in HERMES can be thought of as "living" in one of three layers or areas:</p>

<p>•Normal windows live in the window work area, at the bottom layer.</p>

<p>•Docked windows live at the level of the main HERMES window’s border, the middle layer.</p>

<p>•Floating windows live at the level above the main HERMES window, the top layer.</p>

<p>Therefore, a floating HERMES window floats above all other HERMES windows except other floating windows.</p>

<p>The title bar of a floating window contains, in addition to the title, only the close button. This distinguishes the window from a normal window when both appear to be in the window work area; a normal window’s title bar contains the window-menu icon (left) and three buttons. But also note that a floating window can be dragged outside of the main HERMES window, whereas a normal window cannot.</p>

<p>You can diagonally resize any floating window in HERMES. Simply position the pointer over any window corner, and click and drag to enlarge or reduce.</p>

<p>To convert a window to a floating window, either undock it from the main window, if it is docked, or do the following: right-click the window’s border or tab, make sure the <b>Float In Main Window</b> command is unchecked (turned off) on the context menu (right-click), then turn off (uncheck) the <b>Allow Docking</b> command on the menu. For a docked window, you can also temporarily override the <b>Allow Docking</b> command and suspend docking by holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> key while dragging the window. The window drags as a floating window. </p>

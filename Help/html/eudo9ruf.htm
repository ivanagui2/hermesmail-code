<P>The Make Filter dialog box, discussed in <A HREF="eudo6isn.htm">Quick and Simple Filters with the Make Filter Dialog</A>, lets you create quick, simple filters that perform one operation, that is a mail transfer based on one match condition and specific header information. The Filters window lets you create more complex, powerful filters that use multiple match conditions and perform multiple filter actions. (You can also use the Filters window to create simple filters such as those created by the Make Filter dialog box.)</P>

<P>To create or modify a detailed filter, do the following:</P>

<P>1. To open the Filters window, from the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Filters</B>, or click the Filters window’s tab if it is part of a visible tabbed window group. The Filters window appears, and any filters you have created are listed on the left. (For more information on how to manipulate the Filters window alone and as part of a tabbed window, see <A HREF="eudo1pv7.htm">Window States and Tabbed Windows</A> .)</P>

<P>2. Click the <B>New</B> button or select an existing filter.</P>

<P>3. Choose the options for how you want the filter to be used, as an automatic filter to be invoked on any <B>Incoming </B>and/or <B>Outgoing </B>mail, and as a <B>Manual </B>filter that can be invoked when you choose <B>Filter Messages </B>from the <B>Special</B> menu. Any combination of these options works.</P>

<P>4. Define the criteria for the filter; use the header item drop-downs and the text fields to specify which header items should include a particular string of text. You can define two related terms for the criteria so that your filter is as specific as possible. See <A HREF="eudo3nc9.htm">Filter Criteria (The Match Area)</A></P>

<P>5. Define the action or actions to be taken on messages that fit the criteria (see <A HREF="eudo6dir.htm">Filter Actions</A> ) and save the filters.</P>

<P><I>Note:Eudora places a small icon next to the filter, in the filters list on the left, for each action you have selected for that filter—up to five icons/actions per filter.</I></P>

<P><I>Note:Filters are automatically named based on the criteria for the filter. You can re-order them by dragging a filter up or down in the list.</I></P>

<P>When the filters are invoked (automatically or manually), each message is matched against each filter in order from top to bottom. If the message meets a filter’s criteria, the actions are done as specified until there are no more actions, then the message is matched against the next filter. If at any point a <B>Skip Rest</B> action is done, nothing else is done with that message, and the next message is filtered.</P>

<P>You can change the width of the filters list to create more or less space for your list. To do this, put the arrow over the bar to the right of the list and drag the line to the left or right.</P>

<P>For information on the match conditions and filter actions in the Make Filter dialog box, see <A HREF="eudo6isn.htm">Quick and Simple Filters with the Make Filter Dialog</A>. </P>

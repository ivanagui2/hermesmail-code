<P>If this is selected, you are warned if you try to launch an attachment or program outside of Eudora, for example directly from the Attachments directory or from a Eudora Sharing Protocol (ESP) directory. For security reasons, you should never launch a program without performing a virus check on the file. Do not launch any program or open an attachment if you do not know sender. Some viruses can infect a file without your knowing it. It is always good to perform regular virus checks using a current virus checking program.</P>

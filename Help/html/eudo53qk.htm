<P>The incoming mail server is where your mail is received and stored until it is transferred by Eudora to your computer. You can use several different mail accounts with Eudora: Your main account, or "dominant personality," is specified in <A HREF="eudo9wwx.htm">Configuring Eudora</A>, and additional mail accounts, or "multiple personalities," are described in <A HREF="eudo6lrr.htm">Personalities Window</A> and <A HREF="eudo19gn.htm">Account Settings Dialog</A>.</P>

<P><I>Note:To best understand the functioning of the incoming mail server with respect to Eudora, see the section "Mail Transport" in the Online Eudora User Manual.</I></P>

<P>There are two ways to check your incoming mail server and transfer mail to your computer: automatically or manually. </P>

<P>You can also control how your mail is transferred from the server, and what happens to it on the server. For details, see <A HREF="eudo8kku.htm">Managing your mail on a POP Server</A> and <A HREF="eudo1x2q.htm">Managing Your Mail on the IMAP Server</A>. </P>

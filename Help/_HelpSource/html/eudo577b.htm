<h2><a name="stationery_window"></a>Stationery Window</h2>

<p>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)</p>

<p>Use this window to manage and apply stationery.</p>

<p>To open the Stationery window, do the following:</p>

<p>1. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Stationery</b>. Or, if the Stationery window is in a visible tabbed window, click its tab. </p>

<p>The Stationery window displays a single-column list of your stationery files.</p>

<p><i>Note:You can only select one item at a time in the list; you cannot select multiple items.</i></p>

<p>If you right-click a stationery item in the list, a context menu (right-click) appears with the following commands (the standard HERMES window-management commands appear at the bottom):</p>

<p>•<b>New</b> — Create a new piece of stationery (a new stationery file). An untitled stationery window opens; enter the stationery name and from the File menu, choose <b>Save As Stationery</b>.</p>

<p>•<b>Edit</b> — Open an editing window for the selected stationery item. Make your changes and from the File menu, choose <b>Save As Stationery</b>, or close without saving to discard your changes.</p>

<p>•<b>Delete</b> — Delete the selected stationery item. HERMES asks you to confirm the deletion. Use the <b>Del</b> key (<b>Delete</b>) as a shortcut for this command.</p>

<p>•<b>Rename</b> — Rename the selected stationery file. Use the <b>F2</b> key as a shortcut for this command, or click the stationery file’s name box, then edit the name right in the box.</p>

<p>•<b>New Message With</b> — Create a new message with the selected stationery. As a shortcut for this command, either select the stationery item and press <b>Enter</b>, or just double-click the stationery item.</p>

<p>•<b>Reply With</b> — Reply with the selected stationery to the sender(s) of the received messages that are currently selected.</p>

<p>•<b>Reply to All With</b> — Reply with the selected stationery to the sender(s) and all recipients of the received messages that are currently selected.</p>

<p>You can also display the context menu (right-click) and create new stationery by right-clicking anywhere in an empty Stationery window or by right-clicking anywhere <i>off</i> a stationery item in a non-empty Stationery window. </p>

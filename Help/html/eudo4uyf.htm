<P>The Mailboxes options determine how Eudora displays various objects in mailbox window columns. It also allows you to configure Eudora to select and drag message(s) for mailbox transfers.</P>

<P>To display the Mailboxes options window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, select <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2. Scroll and click <B>Mailboxes</B>. The Mailboxes options window appears.</P>

<P>Listed below are field descriptions for Mailboxes:</P>

<P><B>Show Mailbox Columns —</B>— These options determine which columns are displayed in mailbox windows. Turn on an option to display that column in all mailbox windows. The options are Status, Priority, Attachment, Label, Sender, Date, Size, Server status, and Subject.</P>

<P><B>Show mailbox lines —</B>— If this option is on, lines are displayed in the message summaries portion of mailbox windows, horizontal lines to separate message summaries, and vertical lines to separate columns.</P>

<P><B>Close messages with mailbox —</B>— If this is on, all opened messages in a mailbox will close automatically when you close the mailbox .</P>

<P><B>Select newly inserted messages (FUMLUB)</B> —— If this is selected, the first message of the most current block of unread messages is highlighted in the Table of Contents window when new messages are added to a mailbox, for example, when receiving new messages as a result of a mail check. FUMLUB means First Unread Message of the Last Unread Block. For example, you may have a series of unread messages in a mailbox scattered throughout your Table of Contents. The first message of the last block of unread messages listed in your Table of Contents is selected. </P>

<P><B>When dragging in a mailbox:</B> —— These options determine how you can move messages from one mailbox to another.</P>

<P><B>Allow drag and drop transfers</B> —— If this is on, you can transfer a message to another mailbox using drag and drop: select one or more messages in a mailbox, drag them to another mailbox and drop them in the target mailbox.</P>

<P><B>Allow drag-select of messages —</B>— If this is on, you can click and drag on adjacent messages to select them as a group in the Table of Contents window. This allows you to transfer a group of messages to a mailbox or to delete them if the "Allow drag and drop transfers" is turned on. The drag-select works only if the drag starts on an unselected (not highlighted) message.</P>

<P>By default, the <B>Minimal Headers Only</B> option is turned on in the <A HREF="eudo8rp3.htm">Incoming Mail Options Window</A> for your dominant account and in the Account Settings dialog for your alternate personalities.</P>

<P>As a result, when you check mail for an account and the incoming mail is delivered to your IMAP server, only a minimal amount of information about each message is transferred to your computer. This consists of the information you would see in the message summary of a mailbox window: the sender, the date and time of the message, the subject, and so forth. However, when you open or preview the message, the full set of message headers and the entire message body is transferred to your computer. Whether or not any attachments to the message are also transferred depends on your setting for the <B>Full Message Except Attachments Over _  K</B> option which is found under the Tools menu, Options, then Incoming Mail.</P>

<P>If you always want the full message to be transferred to your computer during mail checks (with or without attachments, as specified separately) rather than just the minimal headers, turn off the <B>Minimal Headers Only</B> option.</P>

<P>2. From the <B>Edit </B>menu, choose <B>Text</B>. The Text submenu appears. </P>

<P>3. Select the desired text format that you wish to apply to the highlighted text. If no text is selected but the cursor is in the message body, then the font-related commands apply the formatting to the next text you type, and the margin-related commands apply the formatting to the current paragraph that contains the cursor.</P>

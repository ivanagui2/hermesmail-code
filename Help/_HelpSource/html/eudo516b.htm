<h2><a name="normal_windows"></a>Normal Windows</h2>

<p>A window is said to be in the <i>normal</i> state if it is restricted to the window work area of the main HERMES window and cannot be dragged out of the main window.</p>

<p>Normal windows can be moved around within the window work area. They can also be minimized and maximized to completely fill the visible window work area. When a normal window is maximized, its title bar partially blends with the main window title bar.</p>

<p>Normal windows can overlap other normal windows and are obscured by both docked and floating windows.</p>

<p>The title bar of a normal window contains the window-menu icon (far left) and three window buttons: minimize/restore, maximize/restore, and close.</p>

<p>A tool window in the normal state, whether alone or in a tabbed group, can be dragged out of the confines of the main HERMES window, but it must first be converted to a dockable or floating window. To perform this conversion, right-click the window’s border or tab, uncheck (turn off) <b>Float In Main Window</b> on the context menu (right-click), then select (turn on) <b>Allow Docking</b> on the menu.</p>

<p>A nontool window in the normal state, such as a mailbox window or a message window, can <i>never</i> be dragged out of the confines of the main HERMES window.</p>

<p>To convert a docked or floating window to a normal window, right-click the docked or floating window’s border or tab, and choose <b>Float In Main Window</b> from the context menu (right-click).</p>

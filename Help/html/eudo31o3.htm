<P>You are not restricted to the default tabbed window arrangements supplied with Eudora. You can mix and match tabbed windows any way you like.</P>

<P>At one extreme, you can have each of the nine tool windows in its own container with its own tab. At the other extreme, you can have all nine tool windows combined into one tabbed window. In between, you can have multiple tabbed windows open at once, mixed and matched to suit your purposes.</P>

<P>To move a window from one tabbed group to another, drag the window tab from the first group and drop it onto the second.</P>

<P>While the drag operation is in progress, the cursor changes and Eudora displays a small ghosted rectangle when you are over a valid drop location.</P>

<P>If you drop the window tab onto another tab in the second group, the new window tab is inserted at that position and the other tabs are displaced to accommodate it. If you don’t drop the tab onto an existing tab, Eudora adds the new tab at the "end" of the group of existing tabs, where that end depends on the location of the tabs in the tabbed window: top, bottom (the default), left, or right. For example, with tabs along the bottom, the "end" is the far right.</P>

<P>Note that the relocated window takes on the window state — normal, docked, or floating — of the destination tabbed window.</P>

<P>To reorganize the left-to-right or top-to-bottom order of tabs within a tabbed window, just drag the tabs left and right or top and bottom. The drop scheme is the same as that described above. </P>

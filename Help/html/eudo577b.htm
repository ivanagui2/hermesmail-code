<P>•<B>Rename</B> — Rename the selected stationery file. Use the <B>F2</B> key as a shortcut for this command, or click the stationery file’s name box, then edit the name right in the box.</P>

<P>•<B>New Message With</B> — Create a new message with the selected stationery. As a shortcut for this command, either select the stationery item and press <B>Enter</B>, or just double-click the stationery item.</P>

<P>In the Statistics options window, you can choose the color and graph type you prefer when displaying and printing the Statistics window found in the Window menu. The Statistics window displays your email usage, that is the statistics on received, sent, and general Eudora usage. You can display this information for the current or previous day, week, month, or year.</P>

<P>To display the Statistics settings dialog, do the following:</P>

<P>1.From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Options</B>.</P>

<P>2.Scroll and click the <B>Statistics</B> icon. The Statistics options window appears.</P>

<P>Choose the options you want to change. Options are described below.</P>

<P><B>Series—</B>This column lists the different timeframes displayed in the Statistics window. Current refers to the current day, week, month, or year, as selected in the Statistics window. Previous refers to the previous day, week, month, or year, as selected in the Statistics window. Average is the cumulative average that occurs on a day-to-day basis. For example, if you choose to view your statistics for each day, the current graph would be today, and the previous graph would be yesterday. The average graph would indicate the cumulative average since you began keeping statistical information in Eudora.</P>

<P><B>Color—</B>Choose the color you wish to represent the current, previous, and average criteria.</P>

<P><B>Graph Type—</B>Choose the graph type you prefer to display for the current, previous, and average criteria. The graph type you choose will appear in the color you chose in the Color column. The graph types you can choose are a line, a solid (filled) area, a graph bar, a circle, diamond, or a square.</P>

<P><B>Count IMAP messages in Inbox only—</B> Turn this option on if you want Eudora, for statistical purposes, to count only the IMAP messages received in the Inbox. Turn this option off if you want Eudora to count all received IMAP messages regardless of which mailbox they are received into.</P>

<h2><a name="receiving_attachments"></a>Receiving Attachments</h2>

<p>Unless you have specified a particular directory for your incoming attachments (see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-00010B">Specifying an Attachment Directory</a>), they are automatically decoded and saved in the <b>Attach </b>Directory in your HERMES Directory. If you receive multiple attachments with the same name, a number is added to the end of each duplicate name in the order they are received.</p>

<p>Attachment names are displayed at the bottom of incoming messages and the message preview window. </p>

<p>To open an attachment from the open message window or the message preview window, click the attachment name or its icon. If you have the application that the attachment was created in, that application launches and the attachment opens.</p>

<p>You can drag and drop attachments from your message. Use this feature to easily file the documents you receive.</p>

<p>If you receive a large message consisting largely of indecipherable text, it is probably an attachment that was not correctly decoded. Usually this is because the attachment headers are formatted incorrectly. To decode an attachment that was not automatically decoded, open the message and choose <b>Save As</b> from the <b>File</b> menu to save the message as a text file. Then run the decoding utility appropriate for the encoding method that the sender used. Decoding utilities can be found at various shareware sites on the Internet. Also see <a href="ms-xhelp:///?Id=HERMES-B01B840A-00019B">Attaching a File to a Message</a>.</p>

<p>When receiving email messages from a mailing list that supports MIME digest, you can now have HERMES create a mailbox specifically for these messages. To turn this feature on, go to the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Options</b>. Scroll and choose <b>Attachments</b>. Check the <b>Receive MIME digest as a mailbox attachment</b> box.</p>

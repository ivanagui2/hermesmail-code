<P>If the <B>Generate Filter Report</B> option is turned on in the <A HREF="eudo8b3r.htm">Getting Attention</A> options window found in Options under the Tools menu, Eudora generates a filter report. This report can be viewed in the Filter Report window found under the Tools menu.</P>

<P>To open the Filter Report window, do the following:</P>

<P>1. From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Filter Report</B>. Or, if the Filter Report window is in a visible tabbed window, click its tab.</P>

<P>If filter report generation is enabled via the option mentioned above, then each time a filter operation is performed, Eudora adds the entry or entries to the Filter Report window and activates the window.</P>

<P>The Filter Report window displays three columns of data:</P>

<P>•<B>Mailbox</B> — Lists the names of the mailboxes into which messages have been filtered during the current Eudora session. Each listing represents one filter operation for that mailbox.</P>

<P>•<B>Messages</B> — For each mailbox listed in the <B>Mailbox</B> column, lists the number of messages filtered into that mailbox during the filter operation.</P>

<P>•<B>Time</B> — For each mailbox listed in the <B>Mailbox</B> column, lists the time that the messages were filtered into that mailbox during the filter operation.</P>

<P>By default, the entries in the window are sorted by time. However, you can click the column headings and sort the display by mailbox names (<B>Mailbox</B>) or by the number of messages filtered (<B>Messages</B>).</P>

<P><I>Note:Whenever new entries are added to the list, Eudora always appends them to the bottom of the list in order of arrival, ignoring the current sort order. Simply click a column heading to re-sort.</I></P>

<P>Select one or more entries in the list and double-click the selection, or press <B>Enter</B>, and Eudora opens the mailbox windows associated with those selections.</P>

<P>The Filter Report listing is a cumulative log of the filter actions for the <I>current Eudora session</I>. Eudora automatically clears the log when you quit the program.</P>

<P>Closing the Filter Report window <I>does not</I> erase the contents of the filter report, as it did in previous versions of Eudora. Only quitting Eudora erases this information.</P>
